The Pauli Cubes appear to be working with the same principles that this "Homemade Quantum Computer" is using.
All you'll need is:

* a weak red laser pointer (the type in cat toys are generally safe)
* polarizing film or polarizing filter. If you have polaroid glasses or certain camera ND filters you may already have this. Otherwise it's available on amazon
* half waveplate (the plastic thing) is this one: <https://www.edmundoptics.co.uk/f/poly>... (λ/2 Retarder Film (WP280))
* You don't need calcite, but if you want to play with it, you can find it on etsy usually. Look for a sample that's exceptionally clear

The polarizers are the key elements of the Pauli Cubes.
You will need three types of polarizers,
plus a piece of unpolarized clear plastic.
The quality quantum computation will vary with the quality of the polarizers.
Here is the full list, based on Papaliolios’s own drawings:

* Unpolarized clear plastic
* Linear polarizer (0 degree) - <https://www.amazon.com/Polarization-Polarizer-Educational-Physics-Polarized/dp/B06XWXRB75/>
* Linear polarizer (45 degrees) - <https://www.amazon.com/Polarization-Polarizer-Educational-Physics-Polarized/dp/B06XWXRB75/>
* Halfwave plate—retarder (fast axis 0 degree) - <https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/polymer-retarder-film/14827/#>
* Halfwave plate—retarder (fast axis 45 degrees) - <https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/polymer-retarder-film/14827/#>
* Quarterwave plate—retarder (fast axis 0 degree) - <https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/polymer-retarder-film/14827/#>
* Quarterwave plate—retarder (fast axis 90 degrees) - <https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/polymer-retarder-film/14827/#>
