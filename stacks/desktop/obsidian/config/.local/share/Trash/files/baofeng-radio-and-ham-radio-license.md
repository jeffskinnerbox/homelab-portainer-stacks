I have already bought the
[Baofeng UV-5R+ 136-174 400-480 MHz FM Transceiver][05]
in the hopes of hacking for something useful ($35 .... why not),
but I have been dragging my feet about getting a amateur radio license.
I then read the Hackaday article "[Sage Advice for the New Ham][03]"
and "[Get Your Amateur Radio License Already][04]".
I told myself it was time.
After a quick look at the [pool of test questions for the license exam][02],
I suspect I could pass the Technician Class, maybe even the General Class,
going in cold, without studying
(by the way, no need to learn Morse Code these day).

>**NOTE:** The Baofeng UV-5R has now been sort of superseded by a new model,
>the [Baofeng F8HP][07].

# Baofeng UV-5R+ 136-174 400-480 MHz FM Transceiver
This is an inexpensive Chinese hand held 5 watt radio,
capable of transmitting and receiving on the 2-meter and 70-cm bands.
Additionally, it can receive on standard commercial FM frequencies as well as weather band!
I bought it because its programmability and others have successfully hacked it

## Limitations of the Baofeng UV-5R and the GT-5R
Compared with the Baofeng UV-R5, the GT-5R
is a 100% compliant with FCC transmit range and spurious emission requirements (aka legal version),
complies with FCC Equipment Rule Part15B and Part90. FCC ID: ①ZP5BF-5 RA(TX) ②2AJGM-UV5 R (RX).

This radio transmits only on 144-148MHz 420-450MHz with compliant spurious emission.
Go with this legal version, beginners would never worry about goofing with authorities or obstruct other important public services by mistakes.

#### Step X: Unlock GMRS Frequencies - ???
The advertised frequency range of Baofeng UV-5R is
Rx-only on 65-108 MHz (commercial FM radio),
Tx & Rx on 136-174 MHz (VHF 2 meter band),
and Tx & Rx on 400-520 MHz (UHF 70 centimeter band).
Notice that the GMRS/FRS bands (462.5625-462.7250 MHz) are not supported by the Baofeng.
At the request of the FCC,
the new Baofeng UV-5R radios (radio issued since approx April 2021) are "locked",
but there is a whay to unlock them.

To unlock the Baofeng UV-5R, follow the steps in this [video][22].

**I got "COPING" not "FACTORY" as the screen message.**

To test

* [UV-5R Hack - Can CHIRP Be Used To UNLock A New Baofeng UV-5R For GMRS? Can the UV-5R Be Hacked?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUPAxow32Xw)
* [How To Unlock A New Baofeng UV-5R - Easy UV5R Jailbreak Hack To Transmit On GMRS & Other Frequencies][22]

#### Step 1: Adding the Chirp tool - DONE
The [official CHIRP website][13] also supports a [PPA repository for the CHIRP program][14]
but its only supported on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal.
I desided to [install CHIRP via Snap package][15] instead.

>**NOTE:** The CHIRP site claims that releases after Ubuntu 20.04 have removed some packages
>that are required for CHIRP to run and you need to install another PPA first.
>I tried this but the install hung on me so I abandoned that approach.

Open a terminal window and execute these commands:

```bash
# install snap package for chirp
sudo snap install chirp-snap --edge
sudo snap connect chirp-snap:raw-usb

# chirp install enters udev rules in /etc/udev/rules.d which need to be activated
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

# list of snaps installed on your system
snap list

# check if chirp is within bin
ls /snap/bin

# check if you see chirp within applications menu
ls ~/.local/share/applications/ | grep chirp

# if you don't see it, add it manually
ln -s /var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/chirp-snap_chirp-snap.desktop ~/.local/share/applications
```

For any reason you want to remove CHIRP from your computer,
just run this command:

```bash
# remove a snap from your system, along with its internal user, system and configuration data
sudo snap remove chirp-snap
```

#### Step X: Connect the Cable to the Computer - DONE
When plugging the cable into your computers USB port,
you expect `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` command will give you the device file for the cable.
Also, when you execute the [`lsusb`][18] command with the cable plugged in,
you'll get something like this:

```bash
# execute lsusb command with the chirp cable plugged in
$ lsusb
  .
  .
Bus 002 Device 005: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 Serial (UART) IC
  .
  .
```

What's going on here?
Under Linux, each and every hardware device, including USB ports,
are treated as a file and called a [device file][19].
A device file allows a user to access hardware devices,
but shields the users from the technical details about the hardware.
A conventional serial port will typically have a device file such as
`/dev/ttyS0`, `/dev/ttyS1`, etc. but a USB serial ports can appear as
`/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyUSB1`, etc. and even appear in `/dev/usb`.

When your device is plugged in, Linux assigns the device file name
as it sees fit and isn’t always predicable ([it doesn’t have to be this way][20]).
To make it predictable, the CHIRP install create a udev rule in `/etc/udev/rules.d`
and that give the CHIRP device a[persistent device name][20].
That device name will be of this pattern: `/dev/ttyUSB*`.

#### Step X: Permission Issue When Connecting With Radio - DONE
But before going any further,
I wanted to heed the [warning with the CHIRP wiki about permissions][17].
Make sure your login's group includes `dialout`.

```bash
# check your group membership
groups ${USER}

# add dialout to your group
sudo gpasswd --add ${USER} dialout
```

**NOTE:** For this change to take effect on the GUI,
[you'll need to logout and back in again][21].

#### Step X: Start CHIRP and Download Contents from the Radio
The [CHIRP wiki lists all the radios supported][16] and you find the Baofeng UV-5R among the many.

Before you begin to use CHIRP with your radio,
it is important to understand the two different modes of operation:

* **Clone -** The radio's memories are downloaded or uploaded all at once in a single clone operation.
You can download an image of this type of radio, which includes all settings, including memories, VFO state, etc.
The radio enters (or must be put into) a special mode of operation while communicating
with the PC and is typically power cycled after completion of a transfer.
Changes to the memories are made against a saved image, and then are uploaded to the radio.
* **Live -** The radio remains on and active during communication with the computer.
Memories are transferred one at time from the radio to the computer or from the computer to the radio.
Changes to memories are made in real time against the radio as they are entered by the user.
An image of this type of radio cannot be saved to disk in the same way that a clone-mode radio can.
If you want to store the memories in a file, you must export them to a `.csv` or `.chirp` file.

 The `.csv` and `.chirp` files may also be opened and edited directly, but you will not be able to upload directly from those types to any of the radios. You must always either download from a radio (or open an image of it) first and then Import the contents of your `.csv` or `.chirp` file into it before uploading.

1. Start CHIRP and Click the **Radio** menu and choose **Download From Radio**
1. The **Clone** window opens
1. Select the serial port you intend to use from the drop down menu
1. Select the correct **Vendor** and (if necessary) the appropriate **Model**
1. Click **OK** to start the download process. Clone-mode radios will display a progress bar indicating how much of the image has been downloaded. Live-mode radios will immediately jump to the memory editor and begin to populate it with memories as they are downloaded from the radio.

    * [How To Program a Baofeng Ham Radio Easy and FAST With CHIRP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpBo5lixsw)

#### Step X: Make Changes
Once you have the radio contents displayed in the memory editor, you can proceed to make your changes. This may include manual edits or importing memories from other sources. If you are using a clone-mode radio, you may wish to save a .img file of your radio as and after you make your changes. Live mode radio users will have their changes immediately take effect in the radio and do not need to proceed to Step 3.

#### Step X: Upload Changes Back to the Radio
**For clone-mode radios only,**
once you have made all the edits you need to make,
you should upload your image back to the radio.
With your image open, go to the Radio menu and choose Upload To Radio.
The Vendor and Model are already known, so all you need to do is choose a serial port.

# History of Ham
The origin of the term "Ham" is not clear but the prevailing theory is the following.
In the early part of the 20th Century,
Radio was proving its usefulness and electronic experimenters would homebrew their own radio stations,
and begin broadcasting.
The burgeoning commercial radio broadcasters would compete head to head
for the radio crystal listening audience (themselves early adopters).
Broadcast professionals would refer to the homebrewers as "Hams" as in bad actors.
Through the power of lobbying organizations,
the Hams of the day were relegated to one small part of radio spectrum.
In the 1920's, Hiram Percy Maxim saw the value of a public with radios transceivers for emergency communications,
and founded the American Radio Relay League (ARRL).

for new amateur radio licenses, license renewals, and changes to existing licenses, like vanity call signs.
While $35 isn't cheap, it's not the end of the world,
and it's better than the $50 fee that the FCC was originally proposing.

# Radio Repeaters
* [Repeaterbook.com](https://www.repeaterbook.com/index.php/en-us/)
* [RadioReference.com](https://www.radioreference.com/)

# Unlicensed Experimental Radio
LowFER (Low-Frequency Experimental Radio) refers to experimental radio communication practiced by hobbyists
on frequencies between 160 kHz and 190 kHz
(sometimes referred to as the 1750-meter band and in the past as the 1875 Meters band)
a part of the radio spectrum known as low frequency.
The practitioners are known as "LowFERs".
By current U.S. and Canadian regulations, LowFER transmitters may not use antennas longer than 50 feet or final RF stage input powers that exceeds 1 watt.

 [FCC part 15](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-15)
 lists all bands that can be used without a license, given that you follow the restrictions for the given band stated by that document.

# HamSCI
HamSCI is a group of amateur radio operators and scientists working together to study the ionosphere
and further the amateur radio hobby.

* [HamSCI](https://hamsci.org/get-involved)

## Digital RF
The Digital RF project encompasses a standardized HDF5 format for reading and writing of radio frequency data and the software for doing so. The format is designed to be self-documenting for data archive and to allow rapid random access for data processing.

 The software implements a data recording format for scientific radio frequency (RF) instrumentation using the HDF5 scientific data format. The implementation is designed for the management of highly time-dependent data from a large number of radio sensors. Applications include radio science (e.g., radio astronomy, geospace radar) and any project requiring the capture and use of RF data as raw digital samples.

# Unlicensed (or nearly so) Amateur Radio

## FRS, CB, MURS, LMR, and GMRS
* **Family Radio Service (FRS)** - no license required, shares frequencies as GMRS from 462MHz to 467MHz, max power is 2 watts, non-removable (small) antenna, can't use repeaters (but you can listen), limit ability for data
* **Citzens Band Radio (CB)** - no license required, 40 channels from 26.965 to 27.405 MHz, AM & FM mode, max power is 4 watts and 12 watts, no data permitted
* **Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS)** - no license required, 5 channels from 151 to 154 MHz, 2 watts max power, you can replace the antenna, no repeaters (todays rules), it can be used for business/commercial use, can transmit data as much as you want
* **Land Mobile Radio (LMR)** - You must have a license and only issued to business or commercial organization, you are issued a frequency that you along can operate on, no antenna restrictions, you can use what every communication protocols you wish and you can encrypt your messages,
* **General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS)** - requires a license but no test, you must transmit with your call sign, 22 channels from 462MHz to 467MHz, up to 50 watts transmit power, you can use repeaters, you can do short burst of data but not automated, you may not transmit on GMRS frequencies using most ham radios (e.g. Baofeng UV-5R is not legal for use on GMRS frequencies, but you can), GMRS is not licensed to business/commercial users

Contrast with
**Amateur Radio, aka HAM Radio** - license requires and there are mutiple types, etc. max power 1500 watts but depends on band

## How To Get A GMRS License
It can be harder to find and fill out the forms for a GMRS license
than it is to take the HAM-Radio Operators License Exam!
The FCC website is used for many things, obtaining other licenses, etc.
The first thing you must do is create a general FCC website login.
This login is called your FCC Registration Number (FRN)
and you must use the FRN to log in to the FCC website.

Check out the web post
"[How To Get A GMRS License – Easy Guide To GMRS Licensing On The FCC Website][11]"
where it will step you through the process.
The FCC website is used for many things, obtaining other licenses, etc.
The first thing you must do is create a general FCC website login.
This login establishes your "FCC User Name".
You will use this to creat an "FCC Registration Numbera (FRN)".
You will use later the FRN to log in to the FCC website.

An FCC Registration Number (FRN) is not automatically associated with your FCC Username Account.
You must use your FCC User Name account and click “Go to CORES”
and link an existing Username Account to your creation of your new FRN.
Check out the [CORES video][12] for detail instructions.

The cost for a GMRS license is $35, its good for 10 years and it covers your entire immediate family. The FCC will issue you a GMRS call-sign, which you, or your family members will use to identify yourself at the end of a transmission, or at least once every 15 minutes if you are in a long conversation. The only other “rules” are that you cannot transmit obscenities, you cannot purposefully interfere with other people or be a nuisance, and you cannot broadcast music – you may also only use a FCC Part 95E Type Accepted radio – all radios for sale in the united states that are labeled as a “GMRS Radio” are FCC Part 95E compliant. You may not transmit on GMRS frequencies using most ham radios – for example, a Baofeng UV-5R is not legal for use on GMRS frequencies. If you are a licensed ham radio operator you must also obtain a GMRS license – a ham license does not authorize you to transmit on GMRS frequencies.

Once completed and after your payment goes through the FCC will send you an email when your license has been granted – This usually takes between 2 and 5 days.
To check the status of your license or to view/update your licensee information, just log in to the FCC website here: https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsEntry/licManager/login.jsp and click on the “My Licenses” or “My Applications” link on the left-side menu.

# Amateur Radio Weak Signal Communication
The FT8 digital mode is the latest in a series of weak signal applications for amateur radio.
Conceived originally for enhancing esoteric propagaint modes such as high speed meteor scatter and moonbounce,
Joe Taylor (K1JT) developed a series of applications including FSK144, JT6M, JT65, and JT9.
When FT8, jointly developed by Joe Taylor and Steve Franke (K9AN),
was announced it was described as being designed for,
“[multi-hop Es where signals may be weak and fading, openings may be short, and you want fast completion of reliable, confirmable QSO’s.][08]”

### Digital Repeater
"Digipeater" is short for "Digital Repeater"; a repeater for packet data rather than voice. Unlike the standard voice repeater that receives on one frequency and retransmits what it hears simultaneously on another frequency, the usual digipeater is a single frequency device. It receives a packet of data, stores it in internal memory and then a moment later retransmits it on the SAME frequency.

APRS is also relatively slow, running at 1200 baud, so video, audio and pictures would be better suited for another protocol.

APRS requires not only a 2m FM transceiver but also a computer with display and TNC radio-computer interface, plus (normally) a GPS receiver.

What can I do with APRS?
In addition to real-time position reporting capabilities using attached GPS receivers, APRS is also capable of transmitting a wide variety of data, including weather reports, short text messages, radio direction finding bearings, telemetry data, short e-mail messages (send only) and storm forecasts.

In North America, 144.39 MHz is dedicated frequency for ARPS throughout the continent
and has been around for 25 years.

# Amateur Radio over the Internet
* [AllStar & Echolink Project](https://w8wky.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Allstar-Echolink-Project-Final.pdf)

AllStar has better audio quality and full duplex. It requires specific hardware and a dedicated computer, usually a single board computer like a Raspberry Pi.

Echolink can be used by simply installing some software on a phone or PC. It is half duplex and has lower but still decent audio quality.

## Echolink
[EchoLink](http://www.echolink.org/)
software allows licensed Amateur Radio stations to communicate with one another over the Internet, using streaming-audio technology.  The program allows worldwide connections to be made between stations, or from computer to station, greatly enhancing Amateur Radio's communications capabilities.  There are more than 350,000 validated users worldwide — in 159 of the world's 193 nations — with about 6,000 online at any given time.

* [Baofeng UV-5R ham radio, talking from Atlanta to Seattle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhr7i-4jbMI)

## AllStarLink
[AllStarLink](https://allstarlink.org/)
is a network of Amateur Radio repeaters, remote base stations and hot spots accessible to each other via Voice over Internet Protocol. AllStarLink runs on a dedicated computer (including the Rasperry Pi) that you host at your home, radio site or computer center. It is based on the open source Asterisk PBX running our app_rpt application. App_rpt makes Asterisk a powerful system capable of controlling one or more radios. It provides linking of these radio "nodes" to other systems of similar construction anywhere in the world via VoIP.
AllStarLink has 26K users and 25K nodes.

AllStarLink's primary use is as a dedicated computer node wired to your repeater or radio. Connections from Echolink, other VoIP clients and telephone calls are supported.

# NOT Ham Radio!

## Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)
Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) is shared wireless spectrum in the 3.5GHz band that could have big implications for building private LTE networks and for extending public 4G and 5G services.

CBRS is a band of radio-frequency spectrum from 3.5GHz to 3.7GHz that the Federal Communications Commission has designated for sharing among three tiers of users: incumbent users, priority licensees and generally authorized, which is lightly licensed.

* The incumbents are those who have historically held exclusive rights to the band, namely satellite ground stations and the US Navy
* Priority licenses were auctioned off last year, allowing licensees to use the band in particular US counties so long as they don’t interfere with the incumbents and tolerate possible interference from the incumbents. (ISPs like Verizon and Comcast spent the lion’s share of the money paid out in the auction.)
* Generally authorized access gives users the right to use the band as long as they don’t interfere with the other two categories of users.

* [FAQ: What in the wireless world is CBRS?](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3180615/faq-what-in-the-wireless-world-is-cbrs.html)
