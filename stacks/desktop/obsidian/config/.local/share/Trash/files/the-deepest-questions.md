As [Bohr said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1293013-physics-is-not-about-how-the-world-is-it-is),
“Physics is not about how the world is; it is about what we can say about the world.”
[Christopher Fuchs describes physics as](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-bayesianism-explained-by-its-founder-20150604/)
“a dynamic interplay between storytelling and equation writing. Neither one stands alone, not even at the end of the day.”
The way I would put it .... The sciences are the stories we tell ourselves to orient us and structure our understanding of the world. It's a mythos.

# 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics

Bell Test and its proof of entanglement.
([Bell’s Theorem: The End of Hidden Variables?](https://medium.com/quantum-untangled/bells-theorem-the-end-of-hidden-variables-43defb2fe0b9))
Showed no sign of hidden variable, and therefore, outcomes are determine only by act of measurement.
What it has shown is that quantum mechanics, as well as all of physics, is non-local.

* **Realism:** The idea that nature exists independently of whether somebody is witnessing it or not.
* **Locality:** The principle that nature is directly influenced only by its immediate surroundings,
  in other words, no information or cause can be transmitted faster than the speed of light.

The universe is not locally real.
Our universe cannot be real, meaning that not a single one of its properties was assigned from creation.
Instead, it is in a constant superposition state (like the balls in our example) until we interact with it.

Likewise, the universe cannot be local.
Being local means only the surrounding spatial and temporal neighbourhoods of a given particle can affect them.
Yet, quantum proves long-distance interactions are possible.

That being said, we still don’t know which of those properties is actually false or even if both are.
All we know is they can’t simultaneously be true.

# Schrödinger's Cat / Elitzur–Vaidman Bomb Tester

The [Elitzur–Vaidman Bomb Tester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester)
is a quantum mechanics thought experiment that uses interaction-free measurements
to verify that a bomb is functional without having to detonate it.
It was conceived in 1993 and real-world experiments have confirmed that their theoretical method works as predicted.
In 2023, Physicists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have successfully recreated
the [Elitzur–Vaidman Bomb Tester within a completely classical system](https://davidson.weizmann.ac.il/en/online/sciencenews/quantum-insights-thought-experiment-reality).
This means we can observ a quantum effect in a system derived from everyday classical physics.
This achievement intensifies the question: **What truly separates the quantum from the classical?**

# Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics

* [I misunderstood Schrödinger's cat for years! (I finally get it!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkHFXZvRNns)
* [From Schrödinger’s Cat to Thomistic Ontology](https://philos-sophia.org/schrodingers-cat-thomistic-ontology/)

[Quantum interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics)
generally fall into two categories: psi-ontological and psi-epistemic.

* **Psi-ontological interpretation (aka ontic interpretation)** view the quantum state as real and existing independently of the observer.
    - Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI)
* **Psi-epistemic interpretations (aka epistemic interpretation)** view the quantum state as descriptive of our knowledge and interactions with the world.
    - Copenhagen Interpretation
    - QBism

No matter which interpretation you choose, there is a philosophical price to be paid.


## QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)
QBism, or Quantum Bayesianism, offers a radical interpretation of quantum mechanics, emphasizing the role of the observer and measurements, contrary to classical physics' objective worldview.

Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Arithmetic is another name for Number Theory
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is also important because it does not hold in all number rings (that is, rings of integers of an algebraic number field). Attempts to understand this led to the important development of ideal numbers by Kummer and Dedekind and the birth of algebraic number theory and modern algebra.

## Metropolis–Hastings Algorithm

In statistics and statistical physics, the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a sequence of random samples
from a probability distribution from which direct sampling is difficult.

Through the use of random processes, this algorithm offers an efficient way to
stumble toward answers to problems that are too complicated to solve exactly.

# Paradoxes of Infinity

A **paradox** is a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition
that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.

A **paradox** is a logically self-contradictory statement or a statement that runs contrary to one's expectation.
It is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises,
leads to a seemingly self-contradictory or a logically unacceptable conclusion.
A paradox usually involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.

# Category Theory

"Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things." ... Henir Poincare
Category Theory is the abstraction of composition.

Category theorists also work on better understanding and explaining challenging problems in physics, engineering, natural language processing and more, in addition to computer science.
In 2004, Professor Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke, from the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now the Computer Science Department), applied category theory to quantum mechanics, to create the new field of categorical quantum mechanics. They explicitly set out to “recast” the mathematics of “quantum mechanics, due to von Neumann”, picking up the baton passed on, over 70 years earlier, when von Neumann expressed his dissatisfaction, particularly with Hilbert space formalism. Abramsky and Coecke’s new formalism, which is as rigorous as von Neumann’s standard system, was designed as a pictorial method for reasoning about quantum processes.
In the years following the introduction of categorical quantum mechanics, Coecke worked with other collaborators to develop and refine the approach, for example in papers with Ross Duncan, A Graphical Calculus for Quantum Observables¹⁵ and with Eric Oliver Paquette and Dusko Pavlovic, Classical and Quantum Structuralism¹⁶, which introduced to the world new elements of graphical notation, including in a variety of instances, an element called a “spider”.
ZX-calculus was formally introduced in a 2009 paper by Bob Coecke (now the Chief Scientist at Quantinuum, a world leader in quantum computing) and Dr Ross Duncan (now Head of Software at Quantinuum) as an intuitive and diagrammatical way of expressing the properties of quantum particles, based on the principles of categorical quantum mechanics.

# Philosophy

It may be wise to learn a little more about philosophy to truly appreciate and master the topics below.
Philosophy is the systematic and critical study of fundamental questions that arise
about existence, logic, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.
The philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.

So [what is Philosophy][04], [why do you need to know about it][05], [is it at all useful][06],
and by the way, [isn't it dead][07]?

# Impulse

A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from A to B is an object f such that every a in A is uniquely associated with an object f(a) in B. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation.

A distribution is sometimes also called a "generalized function" or "ideal function." As its name implies, a generalized function is a generalization of the concept of a function. For example, in physics, a baseball being hit by a bat encounters a force from the bat, as a function of time. Since the transfer of momentum from the bat is modeled as taking place at an instant, the force is not actually a function. Instead, it is a multiple of the delta function.

## Ramsey Theory

Frank Ramsey theorem stated that if a system is large enough,
then no matter how disordered it might be,
it’s always bound to exhibit some sort of regular structure.
Order inevitably emerges from chaos; patterns are unavoidable.
Ramsey theory is the study of when this happens —
in sets of numbers, in collections of vertices and edges called graphs, and in other systems.

# The Speed of Light

Maxwell's equations say the velocity of electrometric waves is inversely proportional
the permittivity and permeability of free space.
It makes sense that the velocity of any wave would be inversely proportional to the resistance of the substance it is traveling in.
You might ask, why does resistance take on the values they do?
No one knows why. These are just the constants of nature.

About 40 years after Maxwell, Einstein did his own thought experiments inspired by Maxwell’s equation.
His thought experiment was based on one simple assumption.
He asked if the speed of light is an inherent property of space,
why would this speed be any different based on the speed of the observer?
And it was from this simple assumption,
that he came up with the special theory of relativity in 1905 which changed our ideas about the nature of time.

# Study of Complexity / Complex Systems

Agent-based models are computer simulations used to study the interactions between people, things, places, and time. They are stochastic models built from the bottom up meaning individual agents (often people in epidemiology) are assigned certain attributes.
The agents are programmed to behave and interact with other agents and the environment in certain ways. These interactions produce emergent effects that may differ from effects of individual agents. Agent-based modeling differs from traditional, regression-based methods in that, like systems dynamics modeling, it allows for the exploration of complex systems that display non-independence of individuals and feedback loops in causal mechanisms. It is not limited to observed data and can be used to model the counterfactual or experiments that may be impossible or unethical to conduct in the real world.

The study of Complex Systems considers the ability of individual components of a large system to work together to give rise to dramatic and diverse behaviour. Complex emergent phenomena are often not predicted by an understanding of the behaviour of the constituent parts underlying them, i.e.

* one water molecule is not fluid
* one gold atom is not metallic
* one neuron is not conscious
* one amino acid molecule is not alive
* one fish is not a school
* one trader is not a market
  In other words, the emergent properties of complex systems are considered to be greater than the sum of their parts.

In physics, magnetism of everyday materials emerges from the spontaneous alignment of the magnetic moment of billions of electrons. Similarly, phenomena such as superconductivity and superfluidity emerge from the cooperative flow of electrons and atoms, respectively, at temperatures close to absolute zero. On a much larger scale, the structure of the universe emerges from the gravitational attraction of matter.

## Computational Complexity Theory

The strongest working definition for computation comes via the (strong) Church-Turing Thesis.
This states that every possible physically realizable model of computation is no more powerful than a Turing Machine.
If you believe that this is true, then although we may have lots of way to express things,
ultimately we can reduce every computation to a Turing Machine,
hence giving a definition of computation as "anything we can reduce to a Turing Machine".
