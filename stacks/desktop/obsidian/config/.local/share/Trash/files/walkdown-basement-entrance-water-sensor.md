I have a walk down basement stair well that can flood
if I make sure the drain is clean and cleared of leaves.
I want to build a sensor to detect water accumulation
(not just wetness but the water rise to a point where it could rise above the door sill).
It needs to be self-sufficient (aka off of mains power) make it challege to power.
I'll need a battery and a solar panel to power the station,
which means adding at least a regulator and charge controller to your build.
I can provide power saving by making periodic measurements between multi-minute deep-sleep cycles.
We'll also need to removing the power from the sensors
when the microcontroller is asleep to avoid very small but impactful currents that will flow.

# Implementing Power Management
Usually, we can model an device power consumption using three different areas:
microcontroller, radio operations, sensors and actuators.
The easiest way to comtrol power consumption by an application using
Arduino, ESP8266, and other compatible devices is implementing the code in the `loop()` method.
For example, when we have to acquire data from a sensor at specific time intervals,
we simply add the `delay(..)` method,
specifying how long the device should wait before starting again and repeat the same tasks.
This approach isn’t the best one when we consider the power management aspect.
There are different ways we can use to achieve a better result.
for example, an [ESP8266 device has four different modes to “sleep” or save the battery][01]:

* **No Sleep -** This is the most inefficient way to use this device. It is always on.
* **Modem Sleep -** This mode is enabled only when the ESP8266 is connected to WiFi.
In this mode, the ESP8266 turns off the WiFi module between two DTIM Beacon interval.
The ESP8266 turns on again the WiFi module before the next Beacon.
Sleep mode is used when it is necessary to keep the CPU on.
* **Light Sleep -** This is mode is very similar to the Modem-sleep mode but in this mode,
ESP8266 suspends the CPU and turns off the clock.
This mode is more efficient than the previous mode.
In Light-sleep mode, the ESP8266 should be woken up using a GPIO pin.
* **Deep-Sleep -** In this mode, everything is turned off except the RTC (Real Time Clock),
so that the ESP8266 can be turned on periodically.
This is the most the most efficient mode.
The deep-sleep mode can be used in scenarios where the device should send data at specific intervals.

## ATtiny13 Sensor Reader
uses an ATtiny13 to actually read the sensor values. The chip doesn’t run continuously, its watchdog is set at 1 Hz, ensuring that the device is woken up often enough so that it has time to power up the sensor

* [ESP32 Soil Monitors Tap Into Ultra-Low Power Mode](https://hackaday.com/2021/01/14/esp32-soil-monitors-tap-into-ultra-low-power-mode/)

## Burden Voltage
In-circuit current measurement requires that the circuit-under-test be opened
and the measurement instrument leads placed in series.
Ideally, the test instrument would appear to the circuit as a dead short.
The reality is that there are always some small, but potentially significant,
resistance from switches, fuses and the meter leads.
The burden voltage is the voltage drop that occurs across the instrument as a result of this additional impedance.

Burden voltage is the voltage drop caused by current flowing through a current measuring device.
A large burden voltage can affect the circuit being measured, corrupting the measurement.

# Ultra-Low Power Design
* [Hardware and Firmware Issues in Using Ultra-Low Power MCUs, by Jack Ganssle](http://www.ganssle.com/reports/ultra-low-power-design.html)

# Amperes vs Power vs Energy
Power consumption measured in watts (usually in milliwatt, mW)
is the correct term for low power applications
but all too often the current consumption, measured in amperes (usually milliamperes, mA),
is what is specificed instead.
As the power is just the operating voltage multiplied by the current,
it is trivial to calculate power for fixed voltage operations
but often voltage changes widely over time and loading conditions.

So more relavent might be the energy consumption, measured in Joules (usually in micro joules, µJ),
that determines how much energy is actually drained from the battery to complete a specific task.
The energy consumption will be the integral of the power consumption over the time needed to perform the operation.
Again, for static signals this is a simple multiplication of power consumption and the time
but with varying signals this will demand more complex analysis.

Where power consumption is most relevant is when using a current-constrained power source,
such as a Lithium-ion coin cell battery.
Batteries like a coin-cell can only source about a few mA current peaks without getting damaged.
By attempting to draw a higher peak, you risk reducing the capacity of the battery permanently,
potentially impacting the output voltage too.
Peak power consumption will not be an issue for applications where there is enough current to support the peak.

It has a range of 28 cm to 750 cm with a **read resolution of 1mm**
(precision isn't specified, but its probably about 5-10 mm).

This sensor has a 'blind' zone distance of 0 to 28 cm,
that means it can't accurately tell when something is less than that distance away.
it's best used when you know that the object you're sensing is at least 30 cm from the sensor!
