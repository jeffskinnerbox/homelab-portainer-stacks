The Phoronix Test Suite is an open-source, cross-platform automated testing/benchmarking software.
The Phoronix Test Suite is the most comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available for Linux, Solaris, macOS, Windows, and BSD operating systems. The Phoronix Test Suite allows for carrying out tests in a fully automated manner from test installation to execution and reporting.
The Phoronix Test Suite can be used for simply comparing your computer's performance with your friends and colleagues or can be used within your organization for internal quality assurance purposes, hardware validation, and continuous integration / performance management.

OpenBenchmarking.org provides
* Storage of Phoronix Test Suite benchmark result data (including optional system logs, etc).
* Effective collaboration tools for sharing results and efficiently comparing multiple test results and other analytical features.
* Package management system for making accessible new, updated, and third-party test profiles and test suites to users of the Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

# Sysbench Benchmarking Tool
Sysbench is a simple to use benchmark tool that features tests for CPU, memory, I/O, and even database performance testing.
Itâ€™s a command line utility that is part of the Linux distribution repositories.
All the tests are easy to execute and you can do a test run with many options but it simple to use defaults.
For example, to run a CPU test, do `sysbench cpu run` (could have used `fileio`, `cpu`, `memory`, `threads`, or `mutex`)
and to see your options for the CPU test, do `sysbench cpu help`
Change the command `run` to `help` to get the options specific to that test.

````

#### Step 2: Test Preperation
* reboot system
* 'turn-off' any periodic background processes
* execute test without browser, etc. running.  Just have a terminal open to run the tests.

#### Step 3: Perform CPU Performance Testing
We are looking for the CPU testing to follow these guidelines:

1. CPU Test (Single Thread)
    * **Number of threads:** The test was run with a single thread.
    * **CPU speed:** The more system event the better
    * **Latency:** The average time taken to process an event should a fraction of a milliseconds, and the smaller the better.
    * **Threads fairness:** All events should be evenly distributed among the threads, with no significant deviation.
2. CPU Test (Multi-threaded)
    * **Number of threads:** The test was run with 4 threads.
    * **CPU speed:** With more threads, the system should process nearly 4x improvement from the single-threaded test.
    * **Latency:** The average processing time remains consistent with the single-threaded test.
    * **Threads fairness:** Events should be fairly distributed among the threads, with a minor standard deviation.

```bash
# test the cpu using a single and multiple threads
sysbench cpu run
sysbench cpu --threads=4 run


sysbench cpu run > sysbench-cpu-1-thread
sysbench cpu --threads=4 run > sysbench-cpu-4-thread
```

#### Step 4: Peform Memory Performance Testing
We are looking for the Memory testing to follow these guidelines:

1. Memory Test (Read)
    * **Memory block size:** The size of the memory block being read was 1K.
    * **Memory operations type:** The test focused on read operations.
    * **Total operations:** The more MiB/sec the better.
    * **Latency:** The average time for memory operations should be very low, close to 0 milliseconds.
2. Memory Test (Write)
    * **Memory block size:** The size of the memory block being written was 1K.
    * **Memory operations type:** The test focused on write operations.
    * **Total operations:** The more MiB/sec the better.
    * **Latency:** The average time for memory operations should be very low, close to 0 milliseconds.

```bash
# test the memory read speed using a single and multiple threads
sysbench memory --memory-oper=read run
sysbench memory --memory-oper=read --threads=4 run

# test the memory write speed using a single and multiple threads
sysbench memory --memory-block-size=1K --memory-total-size=10G --memory-oper=write run
sysbench memory --memory-block-size=1K --memory-total-size=10G --memory-oper=write --threads=4 run


sysbench memory --memory-oper=read run > sysbench-read-1-thread
sysbench memory --memory-oper=read --threads=4 run > sysbench-read-4-thread

sysbench memory --memory-block-size=1K --memory-total-size=10G --memory-oper=write run > sysbench-write-1-thread
sysbench memory --memory-block-size=1K --memory-total-size=10G --memory-oper=write --threads=4 run > sysbench-write-4-thread
```

#### Step 5: Peform File I/O Performance Testing

```bash
# test the file i/o speed using a single and multiple threads
sysbench fileio --file-num=128 --file-total-size=2G --file-rw-ratio=1.5 --file-test-mode=seqwr run
sysbench fileio --threads=4 run


sysbench fileio --file-num=128 --file-total-size=2G --file-rw-ratio=1.5 --file-test-mode=seqwr run > sysbench-fileio-1-thread
sysbench fileio --file-num=128 --file-total-size=2G --file-rw-ratio=1.5 --file-test-mode=seqwr --threads=4 run > sysbench-fileio-4-thread
```

# Phoronix Test Suite
The Phoronix Test Suite is provided via a `.deb` Debien package.
The Debien packages are third-party tools used to install software packages in Linux distributions.
When we use the install tool for Debien package,
there is a possibility that all of the respective dependencies may not install.

Sources:
* [How to Benchmark Your Linux System](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-benchmark-your-linux-system)

#### Step 1: Install Phoronix
To do the install,
log into your Ubuntu Server instance and download the **latest** Phoronix Test Suite `.deb` file.
You should find that file at `https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/releases`:

```bash
# dowenload the phoronix test suite .deb file
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/releases/download/v10.8.4/phoronix-test-suite_10.8.4_all.deb

# install the tool with
sudo dpkg -i phoronix*.deb

# the installation may error out because there are still dependencies to meet
# you can fix that error and complete the installation with the single command
sudo apt-get install -f

# you can verify the installation with
phoronix-test-suite
```

The above verification step should list out all of the help information for the command.

#### Step 2: John The Ripper Benchmark
John The Ripper is a classic password cracking program used by security testers,
but the stress that it places on your CPU makes it an ideal program to test with.
The test will run three times, and youâ€™ll see your results displayed in the terminal.

```bash
# install 'john the ripper'
phoronix-test-suite install john-the-ripper

# run the 'john the ripper' test
phoronix-test-suite run john-the-ripper
```

#### Step 3: LuxMark
LuxMark is another performance test that measures both OpenCL performance of both the CPU and GPU.

```bash
phoronx-test-suite install luxmark
phoronix-test-suite run luxmark
```

#### Step 4: Compile Firefox
Firefox codebase is massive, and it takes a lot of time and system resources to compile.
Its a real world test, especially for your CPU, try compiling Firefox.

```bash
phoronix-test-suite install compile-firefox
phoronix-test-suite run compile-firefox
```
