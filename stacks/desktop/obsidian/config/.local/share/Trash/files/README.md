The earliest meaning of deprecate was 'to pray against, as an evil,' and soon after this first meaning it took on the additional sense 'to express disapproval of'.  Meanwhile, depreciate, the closely related word with which it is often confused, means 'to lower in value.'" align="center">

 We choose to go to the moon.  We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too." align="center" width=500px height=375px>

This directory contains draft documents, maybe just fleeting thoughts, for blog content.
Some documents, maybe most of them, have been in development for a long time and may never get posted.
Never the less, I use this as my repository of ideas that may, someday, become worthy of posting.
