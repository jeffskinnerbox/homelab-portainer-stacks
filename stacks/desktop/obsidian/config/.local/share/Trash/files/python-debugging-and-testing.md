# Python Development Environment / Dev Containerized Environment
If you have more than one Python project,
your going to want to setup separate development environments.
The very act of setting up these environments and maintaining them can be laborious,
even with the aid of Python's virtual environment tools.
And if your sharing a project with teammates,
you have to coordinate the environments across space & time.
A good remedy for this can be containerization of your Python development environment.

## How to Write Pythonic Code

Pythonic describes code that doesn’t just get the syntax right but uses the language in the way it’s intended to be used. Here’s how to optimize your Python code.

* [How to Write Pythonic Code](https://builtin.com/data-science/pythonic)


## Python's Built-in Functions
Python has many built-in functions that you can use directly without importing anything.
These functions cover a wide variety of common programming tasks that include performing math operations,
working with built-in data types, processing iterables of data, handling input and output in your programs, working with scopes, and more.

# Python's Walrus Operator

* [The Walrus Operator: Python's Assignment Expressions](https://realpython.com/python-walrus-operator/)


# Python's Import Statement

The Python `import` statement lets you read (aka copy) a module into your code.
A module, sometimes called packages, is any file that contains
classes, functions, and values that you can reference from your program.
In short, Python modules are `.py` files that contain Python code.

We could import the Python `time` module and make use of the `sleep()` function via the following code:

```python
import time

time.sleep(3)
```

The above `import` statement allows you to import all the functions from a module into your code.
Often, though, you’ll only want to import a few functions, or just one.
that can be done via:

```python
from random import choice

fruits = ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana"]
print(choice(fruits))
```

The default name given to modules in your code is the name of the module.
However, you can override the default module name using the `as` keyword.

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
```

# Python Static Analysis Tools

As projects grow in complexity, ensuring code quality and security becomes paramount.
There are many Python static analysis tools to choose from, but these are most helpful:

* [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) uncompromising Python code formatter.
  It saves you from the minutiae of hand-formatting and freedom from nagging about formatting.
  Install `black` with `pip install black`.
  (**NOTE:** If you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install "black[jupyter]"`.)
* [`mypy`](https://mypy-lang.org/) is a a static type checking tool.
  You can freely mix static and dynamic typing within a program,
  within a module or within an expression.
  No need to give up dynamic typing — use static typing when it makes sense.
  Install `mypy` with `pip install mypy`.
* [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) is a bundle of
  [`pyflakes`](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/), [`pycodestyle`](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/),
  and [`mccabe`](https://pypi.org/project/mccabe/).
  It is faster than Pylint largely because Flake8 only examines the syntax tree of each file individually.
  Install `flake8` with `pip install flake8`.
* [`pylint`](https://www.pylint.org/) is a static code analyzer for Python 2 or 3.
  Pylint analyses your code without actually running it.
  It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for [code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell),
  and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
  Its follows the [PEP 8 style guide for Python code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
  Install `pylint` with `pip install pylint`.
* [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) aims to be orders of magnitude faster than
  alternative tools while integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface.
  Its objective is to replace `black`, `flake8`, `pylint`, and more.
  Install `ruff` with `pip install ruff`.

* Itertools - Itertools is a module in python, it is used to iterate over data structures that can be stepped over using a for-loop. Such data structures are also known as iterables. This module incorporates functions that utilize computational resources efficiently.
