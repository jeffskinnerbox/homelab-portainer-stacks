## Your Next TV
Your next TV will be a lot sharper. Referred to as “4K,” or sometimes ultra-high-definition TV (UHD TV), these televisions offer four times the resolution of a 1080p high-definition television (HDTV).

ATSC stands for the Advanced Television Systems Committee, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that includes more than 100 international broadcast equipment and TV manufacturers, broadcasters, cable, motion picture, satellite and semiconductor companies.

The TV markets now targeted for NextGen TV cover 80 percent of U.S. households. As of June 1, 2022,  55 of the country’s 210 television markets had at least one station broadcasting NextGen TV signals, with another 20 scheduled to start by the end of 2022.
