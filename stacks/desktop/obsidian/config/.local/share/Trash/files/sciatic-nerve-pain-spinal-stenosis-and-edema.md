# Sciatica
Sciatica is an irritation of the Sciatic nerve,
which is really a bundle of three nerves that runs from your lower back to your lower leg.
Sciatic is a symptom, not a diagnoses (aka cause).
The most effective exercises and treatment for sciatica can vary greatly depending on where your nerve pain is originating.
There are three likely cause of Sciatica:

* [bulged / herniated disc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhTDej-LKRM&t=174s)
    * can travel all the way to the foot
    * generally only on one leg
    * numbness or tingling in leg
    * aggravated with forward bending
    * pain is alleviated when standing / walking
