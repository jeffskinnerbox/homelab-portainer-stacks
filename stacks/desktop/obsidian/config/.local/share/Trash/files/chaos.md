Chaos Theory was summarised by Edward Lorenz as:
_Chaos: When the present determines the future, but, the approximate present does not approximately determine the future._

# 1st Example of Chaos
* Henri Poincaré - In his research on the three-body problem, Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system.
* Edward Lorenz and the butterfly effect - He first observed the phenomenon as early as 1961

# Jerk Circuit
Jerk circuit are discribed by equation involves the third derivative of x (time derivative of acceleration).
Such type of a differential equation is called a ‘jerk’ equation.

# "Period Three Implies Chaos" Theory
The theorem refers to period in the sense of function iterations,
**not** in the sense of translation like sin(x) = sin(x + 2*pi).
It applies to particular points, not to the function as a whole.

In dynamical systems, period refers to getting the same result,
not when you shift a function, but when you apply it to itself.
A point x has period n under a function f if applying the function n times gives you x back,
but applying it any less than n times does not.
For example:

* the function f(x) = –x has period 2 for non-zero x, and period 1 for x = 0.
* Period three specifically means f( f( f(x) ) ) = x but x ≠ f(x) and x ≠ f( f(x) ).

Note that this is a property of x, not a property of f per se.
That is, it is a property of f that one such x exists,
but it’s not true of all points.

The thorey states that f is a continuous function from some interval I to itself,
it cannot be the case that all points have period 3.
If one point has period 3, then some other point must have period 4, 5, etc. too infinity.
And there are some points that are not periodic,
but every point in some interval I, non-periodic points are arbitrarily close to a point that is periodic.
That is, the periodic points are dense in the interval.
