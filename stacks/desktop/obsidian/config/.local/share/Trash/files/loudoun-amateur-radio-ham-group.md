# Baofeng UV-5R+ 136-174 400-480 MHz FM Transceiver
This is an inexpensive Chinese hand held 5 watt radio,
capable of transmitting and receiving on the 2-meter and 70-cm bands.
Additionally, it can receive on standard commercial FM frequencies as well as weather band!
I bought it because its programmability and others have successfully hacked it
Some examples of this are:
