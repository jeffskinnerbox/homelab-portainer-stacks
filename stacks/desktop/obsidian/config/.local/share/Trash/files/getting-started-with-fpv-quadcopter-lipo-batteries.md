# Lithium-Ion vs Lithium Polymer Battery
While [Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion)][01] have remained traditionally in all your portable gadgets and smartphones,
[lithium polymer battery (LiPo)][02] are the ones that get utilized in more advanced devices and modern flagship gadgets,
but most of today's all-electric vehicles use Li-ion batteries (though the exact chemistry often varies from that of consumer electronics batteries).
You might think if both these batteries get used in electronic gadgets, they are interchangeable ... not true.
There are important differences between the two, mainly convenience, longevity, and battery safety.

Li-ion batteries have existed for a long time now,
and it is still the most prevalent battery choice for almost every electronic device.
The main reason why these batteries are so popular is that they are long-lasting,
hold a high energy density, and are comparatively affordable to create.
Li-ion batteries can last for approximately 2-3 years or 300-500 charge rounds.

LiPo batteries utilizes a dry solid, gel-like electrolyte rather than a liquid electrolyte,
giving them more options in configurations and sizes.
They are generally consider safter than Li-ion but are not immune from problems like getting punctured or overheated.

For an excellent comparison of Li-ion and LiPo batteries, see [this article][03].
Key technical considerations when choosing a battery are
[energy density][04], [specific energy][05], [memory effect][06] and [self-discharge][07].
The bottomline, for hobbies and most consumer electronics, LiPo batteries are safer, lighter,
have a longer life, charge faster, but can be twice as expensive as Li-ion batteries.

# Selecting and Caring for LiPo Batteries
* [A Guide to Understanding LiPo Batteries](https://www.rogershobbycenter.com/lipoguide)
* [LiPo 3S Battery 101: All About LiPo 3S Batteries](https://www.batteryequivalents.com/lipo-3s-battery-101-all-about-lipo-3s-batteries.html)
* [LiPo Battery Charge Rate Calculator](https://www.hopptbattery.com/a-quick-guide-of-manufacturing-options-for-wearables-4/)

## How are LiPo Batteries Identified
There are four main ratings that you need to be aware of on a LiPo battery.
Lets say we have a battery that states its a 50C, 5000mAh, 3C Charge Rate, 2S 7.4V battery.
What does all this mean:

* **Cell Count / Voltage** - A LiPo cell has a nominal voltage of 3.7V.
For the 7.4V battery above, that means that there are two cells in series (which means the voltage gets added together).
This is sometimes why you will hear people talk about a "2S" battery pack - it means that there are 2 cells in Series.
So a two-cell (2S) pack is 7.4V, a three-cell (3S) pack is 11.1V, and so on.
* **Capacity** - The capacity of a battery is basically a measure of how much power the battery can hold.
The typical unit of measure here is milliamp hours (mAh).
This is saying how much drain can be put on the battery to discharge it in one hour.
Sometime Capacity is expressed in ampere hours (Ah), where 1Ah = 1000mAh.
* **Discharge Rating ("C" Rating)** - The C Rating (the "C" in C Rating actually stands for Capacity)
is simply a measure of how fast the battery can be discharged safely and without harming the battery.
Using the above battery, here's the way you find out the maximum safe continuous amp draw:
50C = 50 x Capacity (in Amps). Calculating the C-Rating of our example battery: 50 x 5A = 250A
* **Charge Rate** - Just as a battery has a C rating for discharging, C rating for charging as well.
For the vast majority of LiPo, the Charge Rate is 1C.
The equation works the same way as the previous discharge rating, where 1000mAh = 1A.
So, for our 5000mAh LiPo, we should set the charger at 5A as the correct charge rate.
The safest charge rate for our LiPo batteries is 3C, or 3 x capacity of battery in Amps.

>**NOTE:** Nominal voltage is not printed on the battery but is the default,
>resting voltage of a battery pack. Its valued for a 1S battery is 3.7V.
>This is how the battery industry has decided to discuss and compare batteries.
>It is not, however, the full charge voltage of the cell.
>LiPo batteries are fully charged when they reach 4.2V/cell, and their minimum safe charge,
>as we will discuss in detail later, is 3.0V/cell.
>3.7V is pretty much in the middle, and that is the nominal charge of the cell.

### The Parameter's Practical Meaning
**Voltage** directly influences the RPM of the electric motor (brushless motors are rated by kV, which means 'RPM per Volt').
So if you have a brushless motor with a rating of 3,500kV,
that motor will spin 3,500 RPM for every volt you apply to it.
On a 2S LiPo battery, that motor will spin around 25,900 RPM (2 x 3.7 x 3500 = 25,900 RPM).
On a 3S, it will spin a whopping 38,850 RPM (3 x 3.7 x 3500 = 38,850 RPM).
So the more voltage you have, the faster you're going to go.

**Capacity** of the battery is like the fuel tank - which means the capacity determines how long you can run before you have to recharge.
The higher the number, the longer the run time.
The bigger the capacity, the bigger the physical size and weight of the battery.
Another consideration is heat build up in the motor and speed control over such a long run.
Unless periodically checked, you can easily burn up a motor if it isn't given enough time to cool down.
Keep that in mind when picking up a battery with a large capacity.

The **C Rating** lets us calculate the maximum sustained amperage load you can safely put on the battery.
Going higher than that will result in, at best, the degradation of the battery at a faster than normal pace.
At worst, it could burst into flames. So our example battery can handle a maximum continuous load of 250A.

While the **Charge Rate** is the safe rate to charge you LiPo battery,
never charge your LiPo batteries unattended!
There is always the potential for fire when using or charging a LiPo batteries.
Another safety precaution is to charge the LiPo in a fire-resistant container.

## How to Charge LiPo Battery
Lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries are a wonder of the modern age
and have revolutionized the hobby of flying RC planes.
But LiPo batteries require specialized care and therefore a LiPo-compatable charger.
They charge using a system called **CC/CV charging**.
It stands for Constant Current / Constant Voltage.
Basically, the charger will keep the current, or charge rate,
constant until the battery reaches its peak voltage (4.2V per cell in a battery pack).

The second reason that you need a LiPo-compatible charger is **balancing**.
Balancing is a term we use to describe the act of equalizing the voltage of each cell in a battery pack.
We balance LiPo batteries to ensure each cell discharges the same amount.
This helps with the performance of the battery. It is also crucial for safety reasons.

For the vast majority of LiPo battries,
the safest charge rate for most LiPo batteries is 1C, or 1 x capacity of battery in Amps.
However, more and more LiPo batteries are coming out these days that advertise faster charging capabilities,
like the example battery we had in the previous section.

### Balance Charger
A balance charger (or balancer) does this by monitoring the individual cell voltages in a pack through a connector on the pack (called a balance connector) and adjusting their rate of charge accordingly. When such a balancer is built into a charger, the charger is known as a Balance Charger or Balancing Charger.

## Measuring LiPo Charge Level
Battery-powered projects require you to monitor your battery's life.
Measuring battery voltage is not ideal, because the voltage doesn't drop linearly.
Battery charge level, aka fuel gauges, are a better alternative.
They work straight away, don't consume power while in standby,
and they're accurate without any calibration!

## Battery
[Gens ace 5000mAh 11.1V 3S 50C 3 Cell LiPo Battery Pack][32] with XT60 and Deans Plug



## Electronic Speed Control (ESC)
An [Electronic Speed Control (ESC)][10] is an electronic circuit that
controls and regulates the speed of an electric motor.
It may also provide reversing of the motor and [dynamic braking][09].

The ESC receive an input pulse position modulation (PPM) signal from the receiver.
This PPM signal is the exact same type of signal that controls the servos.
The ESC uses this proportional signal from the throttle channel of the receiver
to determine how much power to send to your motor to maintain the desired speed.

In the early days of RC technology, it wasn't uncommon to use
one battery for the receiver and another for the motor.
Now a days a battery eliminator circuit (BEC) with in the ESC to the receiver battery.
The high voltage of your LiPo pack is stepped down by the BEC to
a lower voltage of 5-6 volts to power a typical receiver.

An ESC will have three sets of wires.
One set of leads will plug into your your RC car's main battery.
The second set of leads will have a standard servo wire that plugs
into the throttle channel of your RC car's receiver.
The third set of wires actually power the motor.

ESC's are rated for a maximum current.
The more current an ESC is rated for,
the more expensive and heavier it will be.
Choose an electronic speed controller that is rated for slightly
more than what your motor will pull at full throttle.

LiPo batteries will be permanently damaged if the voltage of any cell drops below 3.0 volts.
For this reason, LiPo batteries require an ESC with a low voltage cutoff (LVC).
The LVC will cut the power to the motor when the voltage reached 3.2V,
or whatever you set the LVC to be.

You will also need to choose an ESC that can handle the voltage of the battery pack you plan to use.
The voltage rating for each ESC is clearly stated in the specifications.

# Cold Environment - Lithium Iron Phosphate
LiPo cells must not be charged in freezing temperatures (apart from certain special low temp products), else the cell can rapidly be destroyed due to lithium metal deposition at the anode. Also you need to be careful charging them, especially when theyâ€™re heavily discharged, as they are easily damaged without the proper treatment. LiPo cells operate based on chemical principles â€“ lithium ions literally have to move around inside the structure, and eventually the battery will wear out.

Supercapacitors have the advantage of very long life (but sometimes, they do leak) much more aggressive charging and discharging behaviours and will operate down to very low temperatures. This makes them very useful when a large amount of power is available sporadically (for super fast charge cycles) or in places where temperatures stay persistently very low, such as up a mountain were solar will work, albeit slowly, but LiPo batteries will definitely not be suitable.

Other battery chemistries are available, such as Lithium Iron Phosphate which can tolerate the cold.

## Voltages
Depending on the design and chemistry of your lithium cell,
you may see them sold under different nominal voltages.
Almost all lithium polymer batteries are 3.7V or 4.2V batteries.
What this means is that the maximum voltage of the cell is 4.2v
and that the "nominal" (average) voltage is 3.7V.
As the battery is used, the voltage will drop lower and lower.
Once you hit 3.4V the battery is consided dead
and at 3.0V the protective cutoff circuitry disconnects the battery.
You should see the number 3.7V written on the battery itself somewhere.

**NOTE:** You may also run across 4.1V/3.6V batteries.
These are older than 4.2V/3.7V - they use a
slightly different chemistry and you'll see the 3.6V marking on the cell.
Nowadays you may also be able to purchase 4.35V cells!
These are the latest chemistry, they have a little more power as indicated
by the voltage being higher than 4.2V.
They tend to be cylinder lithium ion's used for laptop batteries, and lights.
Make sure when you're buying batteries and chargers to match them up!
Overcharging a 3.6V battery by attaching it to a 4.2V battery charger
can at the very least permanently damage your battery and at worst cause a fire!

## Protective Circuity
Lithium ion/polymer batteries are extremely power dense.
This makes them great for reducing size and weight of projects.
However, they are not 'safe' batteries and require extra care.
Under certain conditions, some battery chemistries and Lithium is one of them,
are at risk of [thermal runaway][52], leading to cell rupture or combustion.
Thermal runaway is a situation where an increase in temperature changes
the chemical conditions causing a further increase in temperature,
sometimes leading to a destructive heating or fire.

A circuit board attached to the battery can monitor the battery voltage and
the current going out.
These are often referred to simply as protection circuits.
They are very common on standard batteries but you must check the datasheet
or product image to verify that a protection circuit is attached
On Adafruit's lithium ion/ployer batteries,
a protection circuit is soldered onto the battery
and then taped into the little cavity at the top of the battery.
This is very common for lipoly cells and generally provide the following protection:

## Self Discharge
Much attention can be paid to extending battery life through the use of
low-power semiconductors, communication protocols,
and minimizing the time a device spends in â€œactiveâ€™ mode.
However, for very long running applications,
these energy-saving techniques cannot equal the amount of energy lost to
annual battery self-discharge, which often approaches the total amount of energy used to operate the device.

Power sources alkaline batteries are ill-suited for long term deployments,
suffering from very high annual self-discharge rates that exhaust their capacity in 2-3 years or less.
Conversely, bobbin-type Lithium-thionyl chloride (LiSOCl2) batteries
are preferred for long-term deployments due to their
high energy density, high capacity, high voltage (3.6 V),
and an incredibly low annual self-discharge rate that permits up to 40-year battery life.

# Smart Battery System
Smart Battery System (SBS) is a specification for managing a smart battery, usually for a portable computer. It allows operating systems to perform power management operations via a smart battery charger based on remaining estimated run times by determining accurate state of charge readings.

# Battery Degradation
A useful why to think about a batterys degradation or age
in terms of present capacity versus original (new) capacity.

A useful battery has predictable behavior; it can supply a constant amount of power, for a predictable amount of time, within a narrow voltage range. The â€˜capacityâ€™ or â€˜C ratingâ€™ for batteries is probably the most useful parameter to express this.

## Smoke Stopper / ShortSaver
The [Flight XT30/ XT60 Smoke Stopper][51]
short-circuit protection / safety inspector for 2S to 6S LiPo batteries.
It can help avoid damage when you power on your quadcopter for the first time.
It has both a XT30 and XT60 connector so it can fit a range of batteries.
The Smoke Stopper has an LED indicator that turns solid green in normal situation (aka correctly wired & no short circuit),
but the LED indicator turns off and starts beeping in abnormal situation (aka there is a wiring error & there is an overload or short circuit).

# CellMeter
I also purchased a [Cellmeter 8 Digital Battery Capacity Checker][13] from Amazon in October of 2023.
This device support battery types LiPo, LiFe, Li-ion, NiCd, NiMH
It measure battery cell voltages, total voltages, lowest cell voltage, highest cell voltage,
voltage gap between highest cell voltage and lowest cell voltage, remaining battery capacity (%).
