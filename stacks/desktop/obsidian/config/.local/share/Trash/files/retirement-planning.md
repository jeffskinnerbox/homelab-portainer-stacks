# SECURE 2.0 Act
The SECURE 2.0 Act changes the rules covering 401(k) accounts and required minimum distribution rules.

* Starting age for required minimum distributions(RMD) from tax-deferred retirement accounts to 73, from 72 previously. Then, in 2033, the starting age will increase again to 75.
* the 50% penalty for failing to take your RMD will fall to 25% this year. In addition, if you correct an RMD mistake in a timely fashion, the penalty is further reduced to 10%.
*  the law also does away with RMDs for Roth 401(k)s, but this doesn't take effect until 2024, so you'll still need to take an RMD in 2023

# How can I make my retirement savings last?
For a high degree of confidence that you can cover a consistent amount of expenses in retirement (i.e., it should work 90% of the time), aim to withdraw no more than 4% to 5% of your savings in the first year of retirement, and then adjust the amount every year for inflation.

    * In 2023, for people 50 and older, the catch-up contributions also rose, to $7,500 from $6,500.

## Required Minimum Distributions (RMD)
* When you reach age 70½, you're required to withdraw a certain amount of money from your retirement accounts each year.  That amount is called a [required minimum distribution, or RMD][01].
* I belive SECURE 2.0 legislation now requires distributions to begin by April 1st of the year following the year in which you turn 72.  For me, this is April 1st of 2029.

# Deferred Income Annuity
The concept behind income annuities is that the buyer deposits a lump sum or series of payments with an insurer.
In return, the insurer guarantees to pay you a stream of income in the future.
That’s why it’s known as a deferred income annuity (or a longevity annuity).

# Social Security

## Social Security Spouse's Benefit Estimates
The spousal benefit can be as much as half of the worker's "primary insurance amount," depending on the spouse's age at retirement. If the spouse begins receiving benefits before "normal (or full) retirement age," the spouse will receive a reduced benefit.
The best strategy to claim Social Security retirement benefits as a spouse is to wait until you reach normal retirement age, 65 to 67, depending on birth year

## Taxes on Social Security
You will pay tax on only 85% of your Social Security benefits, based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules.
If you:

* **file a federal tax return as an "individual"** and your combined income is
    * between $25,000 and $34,000, you may have to pay income tax on up to 50 percent of your benefits.
    * more than $34,000, up to 85 percent of your benefits may be taxable.
* **file a joint return**, and you and your spouse have a combined income that is
    * between $32,000 and $44,000, you may have to pay income tax on up to 50 percent of your benefits.
    * more than $44,000, up to 85 percent of your benefits may be taxable.
* **are married and file a separate tax return**, you probably will pay taxes on your benefits.

Each January, you will receive a Social Security Benefit Statement (Form SSA-1099) showing the amount of benefits you received in the previous year. You can use this Benefit Statement when you complete your federal income tax return to find out if your benefits are subject to tax.

If you do have to pay taxes on your Social Security benefits, you can make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS or choose to have federal taxes withheld from your benefits.

Social Security can potentially be subject to tax regardless of your age. While you may have heard at some point that Social Security is no longer taxable after 70 or some other age, this isn't the case. In reality, Social Security is taxed at any age if your income exceeds a certain level.

# Will a Job Affect My Social Security?
Your full retirement age is 66 and 4 months.

You can earn up to $17,640 with no penalty.
Your benefits are reduced by $1 for every $2 earned over the limit.
For example, if your retirement job pays $20,000 a year and your Social Security payout is $12,000 a year,
that payout would fall by $1,480 (about 12%) to $10,520.
It is still generally advisable to work longer -- and hold off on receiving social security benefits as long as you can.
You can wait as late as age 70.

## What Savings Do You Need to Retire
The typical advice is to replace 70% to 90% of your annual pre-retirement income through savings and Social Security.

Are you saving enough for retirement along the way?  - A good guideline is to save at least ten times (10x)* your yearly salary by age 67
(The analysis above is based on assets held at Fidelity in your workplace savings plan and does not include other accounts such as an IRA, pension, company stock, or plan with a former employer.)

# 2023 IRS 401(k) Contribution limits
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publishes annual limits on employee’s eligible 401(k) contributions and compensation. The chart below outlines your Verizon 401(k) contribution and compensation limits for 2023. The change in limits for 2023 provides an opportune time to review your contribution percentage and make appropriate adjustments toward achieving your long-term financial goals.

|         Limit Type         |        Amount          |
| Before-Tax and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions | $22,500
Once you reach this limit, your elected Before-tax and/or Roth contributions will automatically switch to After-tax contributions (also known as “spillover”) for the remainder of the year. You can choose whether to “spill over” all of your contribution elections or only those that are eligible for company matching contributions.  |

| Non-Highly Compensated Employee (HCE) contribution rate |
Employees who earned less than $135,000 in 2022* can contribute up to 50% of eligible pay on a combined Before-tax, After-tax, and/or Roth 401(k) basis. |

| HCE Contribution Rate |
Employees who earned $135,000 or more in 2022* can contribute up to 16% of eligible pay on a combined Before-tax, After-tax, and/or Roth 401(k) basis. |

| Catch-up Contributions |
Eligible employees who are turning age 50 or older in 2023 may make additional “catch-up” contributions up to $7,500 on a combined Before-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis. |

| Compensation Limit | Once eligible pay reaches $330,000, contributions to the 401(k) Plan must cease.
Annual Additions Limit	Employees may contribute up to $66,000 in 2023 in any combination of Before-tax, After-tax, Roth 401(k), and company matching contributions. Once this limit is reached, all contributions to the 401(k) Plan must cease. Catch-up contributions are excluded from the limit.|

# Can I roll over my pension to an IRA?
