## Microphone Types
Dynamic Microphone
ECM Microphone
MEMS Microphone
Ribbon Microphone

Digital microphones are available with two different output formats: PDM and I2S.
The output of a PDM (pulse density modulation) microphone is a 1-bit high sample rate data stream
that is the direct output of the Sigma-Delta modulator that's in the mic.
The sample rate of this PDM stream is typically between 1 and 3.25 MHz.
Before this PDM data can be further processed,
it needs to be decimated to a lower sample rate that other devices,
such as codecs and DSPs, can handle.
This decimation filter is implemented in the codec or DSP to which the PDM microphone is connected.
The output of this filter gives data at a lower sample rate, typically between 16 and 48 kHz.

### Dynamic Microphone
A dynamic microphone operates on the same basic electrical principles as a speaker, but in reverse. Sound waves strike the diaphragm, causing the attached voice coil to move through a magnetic gap creating current flow as the magnetic lines are broken.

### PDM Microphone
Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) Microphone,
sometimes called MEMS microphone since the are designed with Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) components,

* [An Introduction to MEMS Microphone Arrays](https://www.cuidevices.com/blog/an-introduction-to-mems-microphone-arrays#overview)

* https://www.amazon.com/s?k=MEMS+Microphone+Breakout&i=electronics

### ECM Microphone
Electret Condenser Microphone (ECM microphone) apply the principle of capacitor charge/discharge for operation. The diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, the vibration is generated due to the sound, then produce the changes of charge between the plates to make the signal transmission.

Electret Microphones: Adafruit [MAX4466](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063) or [MAX9814](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1713)
MEMS Microphones: Adafruit [SPW2430](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2716) or [PDM MEMS](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3492) or [PDM MEMS with JST SH connector](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4346)
The MAX4466 is quite classical and has an integrated op-AMP and gain can change from 25x to 125x while the MAX9814 has an automatic gain control. However "max gain" can obviously me modified. Finally the SPW2430 is the smaller one and probably the best for audio detection while the two previous ones can be used for recording/sampling - but "the output peak-to-peak voltage has a 0.67V DC bias and about 100mVpp" - so it's the more likly to clip/sature on high-level sounds. So at this point we don't have any favorites !

# Electret Microphone with Audio Amplifier
I purchased a [Electret Microphone with a audio amplifier][22];
the audio amplifer being the [MAX4466][21].
On the back there is a small trimmer pot to adjust the gain from 25x to 125x.
At the lowest gain, you at about 200mVpp (normal speaking volume about 6" away),
up to about 1Vpp at high gain (see [mic level vs line level][20]).
The output is [rail-to-rail][23] so if the sounds get loud, the output can go up to 5Vpp!

For use:
* **To power it,** you should connect GND to ground, VCC to 2.4-5VDC. Use the "quietest" supply available (3.3V or 5V microcontrol supply).
* **Output** for the audio waveform will come out of the OUT pin. The output will have a DC bias of VCC/2 so when it's perfectly quiet, the voltage will be a steady VCC/2 volt (it is DC couple - see [AC versus DC coupling][24]).
* **Audio applications** that require AC coupled audio,
place a 100uF capacitor between the OUT pin and the input of your device.
If you're connecting to an audio amplifier that has [differential inputs][25] or includes decoupling capacitors,
the 100uF cap is not required.
* **Drive speakers** or anything but the smallest in-ear headphones. you will need an audio amplifier
* (such as [3.7W stereo amp][26]) and connect the amp output directly to speakers.
* **Drive microcontroller** you don't need an amplifier or decoupling capacitor.
You can connect the OUT pin directly to the microcontroller ADC pin.
