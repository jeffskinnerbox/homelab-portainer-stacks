# How to Start FPV Flying
* [New to FPV drones? DONT do these things unless you want to cry // Beginner tips for success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s51q5eEQu0s)
    1. Start out in a simulator since you are going to crash a lot.
    2. Master race gates before you do acrobatic flying.
    3. Learn how to fly in Acro Mode (aka Manual Mode and Rate Mode) not in Self-Level Mode (aka Angle Mode and Horizon Mode) [Acro Mode vs. Self-Level Mode](https://oscarliang.com/rate-acro-horizon-flight-mode-level/).
    4. Never let your goggles lens see the sun.
    5. When you get a new quadcopter, always check your prop directions in Betaflight.
    6. When you get a quadcopter, use the FC install before flashing and always have a backup.
    7. Never tune your FC until you have some experience with multiple quadcopters.
    8. When building a quadcopter, always use a meter to check for shorts and always use a smoke stopper.
    9. Always take your props off when working on the bench.
    10. Always do a per flight check before doing a flight.
    11. If there are other pilots in the air, do not plug your quad in until you validate your on a unique video channel.
    12. Stand-off about 15 feet from other pilots to reduce interference.
    13. Don't jump on the hype train.  Don't hype something that some other person you like is hyping it.  Look for concrete facts & evidence.
    14. Don't get discouraged. The learning curve is long and things get broken. Fall in love with the journey and not just the destination. You will have set-back.

## What is Steam?
[Steam][20] is an online platform where you can download and play thousands of games on Linux,
and also discuss them with the community.
Steam can also use [Proton to play Windows games on Linux][21].
The [Proton compatibility layer][22] is changing the gaming landscape on Linux.

After purchase,  Steam client lets users install games directly to your Steam account in the cloud.
In addition, Steam users have the flexibility of posting their reviews, uploading self-made content, and more.
The Steam client also has several features, such as access to a friend list,
making an automatic update, in-game voice chat, and sharing games among friends.
Steam works on Windows, TV, mobile, Linux, and MacBook devices.
To use it, you just need a broadband connection to achieve a high-speed internet connection
and a modern system to play games unstoppably.

#### Step X: Install Steam - DONE ... NOT
First, go to the [Stream cloud store][20] and create an account.
You can do this via the login button at the top right.

For Linux, do this:

```bash
# add the multiverse repository, which is a repository that includes non-free software titles
sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
sudo apt update

# install steam
sudo apt install steam
```

After the Steam installation completes, open Steam from the commandline via `stream` or from your desktop menu.
On its first run, Steam will download and apply a full update, so allow that to complete.

Now do the following:

1. Now install the free version FPV.SkyDive by first searching for it within the Steam client,
and then click to the icon to get to the "FPV SkyDive : FPV Drone Simulator",
then select "Play Game" or "Add to Library".
2. FPV.SkyDive will be installed within your `$HOME` directory within a hiden directory,
in my case `/home/jeff/.steam`.
3. On the Steam client, click the button **Play Now**.

For MacOS, do this:

1. In a web browser, go to `store.steampowered.com`.
2. Click **Install Steam** at the top of the page, then on the next page, click the **INSTALL STEAM** button that has an Apple logo on it.
3. If the installer doesn’t launch automatically when it has finished download, go to your `Downloads` folder and double-click it
(Tip: you can get to your downloads folder quickly by clicking the show downloads button in your browser’s toolbar).
4. When the disk image mounts and opens, drag the Steam icon to your `Applications` folder.

#### Step 1: Install VelociDrone - DONE
Go to [Velocidrone's Shopping site](https://www.velocidrone.com/shop) register yourself.
Once you are completely registed, you can purchase the VelociDrone License and Micro Class Quads packages.
At the completion of the purchase, you can go to the [Download tab](https://www.velocidrone.com/account/my_licenses)
to download a MacOS, or Linux, or Windows package.

For Linux, do this:

```bash
# unzip the velocidrone zip file
cd ~/Downloads
unzip velocidrone.zip

# execute the launcher
Launcher
```

For MacOS, do this:
