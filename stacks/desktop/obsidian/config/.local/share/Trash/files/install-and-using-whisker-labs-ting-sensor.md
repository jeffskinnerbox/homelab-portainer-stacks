[Ting][01], developed by [Whisker Labs][02],
claims to help prevent electrical fires before they happen.
Ting is designed to sense, through the homes electrical wiring,
hidden electrical fire hazards as they start to form,
before they had a chance to evolve into a fire.
Ting attempts to identify the unique signals generated by tiny electrical arcs,
which are the precursors to imminent fire risks.
These signals are weak but are made visible thanks to Ting's detection technology.
These signals usually develop over weeks and months,
so Ting is designed to provide you with advanced warnings to address these hazards,
prior to the hazard starting an electrical fire.

I got my [Ting device free of charge][03] through Whisker Labs'
relationship with my home owners insurance company, State Farm.
[State Farm provides a free Ting device][06] via its [enrollment program][07]
which give me a free Ting device (a [$100 value][05])
and 3 years of free service for the Ting device.

# Installation
The Ting device is very simple do-it-yourself (DYI) installation.
You just need to download the [Ting Sensor Mobile App][08]
plug in the Ting device into a normal 120V outlet
in an empty wall outlet in a lesser-used part of your home.
You find all the required installation steps in the [Ting User Manual][09]
(also on the mobile app) and the ["Get Help"][10] website.

# Ting MAC Address
I found the MAC address prefix of Whisker Labs Ting product at [MAC Address Lookup][12].
The Ting's MAC address prefix is `80:6A:10`.

# Ting API Support
At this time, it appears Whisker Labs has some Ting product API in a beta program
(see [Whisker Labs API Reference][11]).
The APIs are document & published on the Web but you cannot get an APIKey at this time.
