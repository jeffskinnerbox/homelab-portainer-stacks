Before the 1970s, engineers working on electronics did not have solderless breadboard.
Instead, they would build electronics by literally hammering nails into a wooden board,
not necessarily literally a bread board,
but usually just a plank purchased from a hardware store.
Once it was cut to the right size, the electronic parts would be nailed or glued
to the board and electrical connections made by soldering or wrapping wire around the nails.
For a while in the 1960s to part of the 1980s,
engineers and makers used some other techniques like wire-wrapping which solved the 'complex circuits'
issue but was still semi-permanent.

In the early 1970's, Ronald J Portugal came up with this brilliant invention of the soderless breadboard.
It was patented 2 years later and the patent expired in 1987.

# Potentiometer
A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.

# Magnet Wire
[Magnet wire][07] is a copper or aluminium wire coated with a very thin layer of insulation.
It is used in the construction of transformers, inductors, motors, generators, speakers,
electromagnets, and other applications that require tight coils of insulated wire.
The wire itself is typically fully [annealed][08], electrolytically refined copper.
The insulation is typically made of tough polymer film materials
(typically not enamel wire dispite often being called "enameled wire").
