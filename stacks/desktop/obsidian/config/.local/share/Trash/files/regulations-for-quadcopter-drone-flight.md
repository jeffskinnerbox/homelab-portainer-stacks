# Drones

Drones are defined as "an unmanned aircraft or ship guided by remote control or onboard computers",
and have been around for over [100 hundred years][01].
These remote-controlled flying crafts have become an increasingly popular project to work on,
including building and racing them.
[FPV Drone Racing][02] has become a popular sport and it even has its own league.
The Drone Racing League was created in 2015 and features racing with custom-built drones that traveling over 100 MPH.
And [FPV flying is just plan cool][29]!

# Local / State / Federal Drone Regulations

A quick search on Google's news feed, with the search phrase of "drone laws",
will give you reason to have considerable concern about viability of this hobby.
Along with concerns about law enforcement use of drones,
you'll find concerns about the commercial and the recreational use of any unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
The FAA and FCC have weighted in for good reasons, but so have local, state, and other federal government bodies.
The regulators concern themselves with the following broad categories:

1. What organizations have regulatory control over drone flying?
1. What training and license you must have to fly?
1. What you & your drone must be doing prior to and when flying?
1. Where & when you can fly?

While regulations/laws very,
aspects of them will apply anywhere in public or private spaces, indoors or outdoors.
And when there is government regulations,
there will be advocacy groups that will be attempting to keep the regulations limited.
This is certainly happening with UAV regulations with a focus on preserving
the widest possible use in commercial world and recreation.
Some of these groups (called community based organization or CBO) are:

- [Academy Of Model Aeronautics (AMA)](https://www.modelaircraft.org/) - AMA is a nonprofit community of enthusiasts who come together to celebrate model aviation.
- [FPV Freedom Coalition](https://fpvfc.org/) - The FPV Freedom Coalition was created to advocate for recreational FPV pilots through education and safety guidelines to protect our access to ample airspace. Through this, we protect the ability of FPV pilots to fly and to do so safely, armed with the knowledge that they need to interact with the general public in a positive and respectful way. Together, we seek to unite the community into a single voice through which our concerns and needs can be heard.
- [Flite Test Community Association (FTCA)](https://ftca.flitetest.com/) - FTCA is designed to be the hub where the people identifying with the community can rally together to promote the future of model aviation. Our vision is simple, we want to bring hope for the future of the hobby.
- [STEM+C](https://stemplusc.org/stemc-cbo/) - STEM+C's mission is to expose students, teachers, and anyone of any age to hands on learning through model aviation.
- [Pilot Institute](https://pilotinstitute.com/) - The Pilot Institute have helped over 250,000 people become airplane and drone pilots. Their courses are designed by industry experts to help you pass FAA tests for s starting a drone business or learning to fly.

Some of these groups are well worth joining and participating in.
They can provided you advice and a voice to speak for you interests.
The also may provide some services (e.g. Insurance) and membership may even be required to fly in some private spaces.

Now lets dive deeper in how the regulatory categories referanced above apply to me in Leesburg Virginia.

These sources provide a broad overview (but not as specific as the sections below):

# What organizations have regulatory control over drone flying?

## Federal Regulators

The primary Federal drone regulator is the [Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)][14],
and to a lesser extent,
the [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)][16].
The FAA has jurisdiction over the air space that drones fly within,
and FCC has jurisdiction over the radio spectrum used by the drones radio controller & video systems.
The FAA has been working hard over he past several years to establish clear rules that will accommodate
the recreational and commercial use of drones, but it is still very much a work-in-progress.
On the other hand, FCC rules concerning the use of radio spectrum are well established,
but frankly not closely followed by the drone flying community (more on this later).

### FAA Drone Regulations

The specific details of FAA drone regulations can be found on their
website [Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) / Drones][19].
Another good source for detail information (in plan English, less government speak)
is the Pilot Institute's [video series on Federal regulation concerning drones][20].

There are three broad categories that drone regulation falls in:
Recreational Flyers (for people like my self),
Certificated Remote Pilots (aka Part 107 Certification Pilots, for commercial businesses but this license has advantages for recreational flyers),
and Public Safety & Government (this applies to organizations like law enforcement).
I'm going to cover here only things relevant to recreational flying,
sometimes call a hobbyist flyer.

The Basics for Flying Recreational FPV:

1. Take The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST).
   This is a requirement before flying recreational and its free & easy.
   Recommended place to due your TRUST is [Pilot Institute][23]!
2. Fly with safety in mind. Here are some [safety guidelines][24].
3. Fly with a visual observer (spotter) co-located and in direct communication with the operator.
4. Fly within Class G airspace. Visit the [FAA Facility Maps][25] to locate your area.
   Any area not covered by a grid is Class G airspace.
   Flights within controlled airspace (generally near airports) require [LAANC authorization][26].
5. Operate the aircraft in a manner that does not interfere with and gives way to any manned aircraft.
6. Stay below 400 feet above ground level (AGL).
7. If your UAS is between 250g (.55lbs) and 25kg (55lbs) you must [register with the FAA][09] and put your registration number on the outside of your aircraft.
8. Regulations DO apply to ALL model aircraft, even those under 250g. There is no lower weight limit exemption.

For the TRUST testing,
I took the [Pilot Institute's free recreational flying course][31],
reviewed a [FAA Part 107 Pilot Exam Study Guide][32] to give myself some further depth,
and followed this with the [Pilot Institute's TRUST Certification][33] test.

### FCC Drone Regulations

#### Which license for me?: Part 107 or Recreational

- [9 things to qualify for the Recreational Flyer Exemption](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/UqWFGjGQSnC1y5JmGB1H)
  1. Fly only for recreational purposes (enjoyment).
  2. Follow the safety guidelines of an FAA-recognized Community Based Organization (CBO). - [FPVFC example](https://fpvfc.org/safety-guidelines), [FTCA example](https://ftca.flitetest.com/safety-guidelines/)
  3. Keep your drone within the visual line of sight or use a visual observer who is co-located (physically next to) and in direct communication with you.
  4. Give way to and do not interfere with manned aircraft.
  5. Fly at or below 400’ in controlled airspace (Class B, C, D, and E) only with prior authorization by using [LAANC][26] or [DroneZone][09]. [FAA UAS Data on a Map](https://faa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=9c2e4406710048e19806ebf6a06754ad)
  6. Take The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) and carry proof of test passage.
  7. Fly at or below 400 feet in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace. Classes of airspace and flying restrictions can be found on our B4UFLY app or the UAS Facility Maps webpage.
  8. Have a current registration, mark your drones on the outside with the registration number, and carry proof of registration with you. - [FAADroneZone][09]
  9. Do not operate your drone in a dangerous manner. - For example: Do not interfere with emergency response or law enforcement activities. Do not fly under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

#### Is a Ham Radio License Needed When Flying FPV?

The short answer is yes, you need at least a Level 1: [Technician License][21] to operate FPV drones legally.
The vast majority of FPV VTX (video) systems operate in the 5.8 MHz ham radio bands, between 5.650GHz to 5.925GHz.
These frequencies are governed by [FCC Part 97][22] (aka ham radio, amateur radio).
Take a look at [this chart][28] for a visual representation
of the various FPV VTX bands, frequencies, and how they fall in the amateur range.

> **NOTE:** There are some FPV video systems that operate with FCC Part 15 certified equipment.
> For these systems, you do not need a ham radio license.
> For example, the [DJI FPV drone][30] operates on part 15 on some of their channels.
> However, even for this DJI FPV system,
> if you want to operate on the high power modes, a ham radio license is required.

Anything that broadcasts a radio signal in the United States must follow the rules of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
According to the FCC there are basically two ways to operate equipment,
such as our FPV video transmitters (VTX), within the RF spectrum allocated for such use.

1. The first way is to use equipment that is certified by the FCC under part 15,
   which means the company who created it has submitted it to the FCC for approval
   and the FCC agrees that the equipment meets all the standards,
   transmits at appropriate power levels, does not cause interference, and so on.
2. The second way to comply with the FCC rules is to have an amateur radio operators license.
   In that case you have proven that you understand the FCC rules,
   you know how to operate radio broadcasting equipment,
   and you can be trusted to operate hardware that has the potential to cause interference to others.
   This license then gives you permission to use these devices within appropriate power levels
   on frequencies within the US amateur allocations.

Except in a few cases, none of the modern FPV video transmitters has an FCC part 15 certificate.
Therefore the person operating the equipment must have a Technicians level ham license in order to operate it.
This is why you see a warning on all the major FPV stores in the US when you try to purchase a VTX from their website.
They are letting you know that it is YOUR responsibility to follow the regulations and know how to use this equipment properly.

In summary, the use and operation of FPV analog & digital VTX 5.8GHz product in the USA,
and many other countries, requires a license and some countries may forbid its use entirely.
In the USA, you will need a "HAM" amateur radio license.
Make sure to [learn more about HAM licenses][17], and [find a HAM license exam session in your area][18].
**It is your responsibility to ensure that the use of this product meets the requirements imposed by your government's rules and regulations for RF devices.**

### Is there a age limit to do recreational flying?

### The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)

Anyone flying their drone in the United States for recreational reasons needs to
pass [The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)][04] exam to legally fly.
The exam is online, takes about 30 minutes, is free of charge, and its one-and-done (aka no need to renew).
You must download and print your certificate immediately upon finishing.
There are multiple [approved Test Administrators][05] to provide TRUST as an online test.
While flying and asked by law enforcement officers,
you must present a copy of your certificate.
If you lose your certificate, you will need to re-take the TRUST exam.

To pass the TRUST exam, you need to understand recreational flying requirements.
Visit the FAA's Recreational Flyers page to [learn about rules for recreational flyers][06].

# UAS Declaration of Compliance System

This system is used for submitting Declarations of Compliance (DOC) to the requirements of Part 89 for unmanned aircraft Remote Identification (RID) and Part 107 Operation of Small Unmanned Aircraft over People (OOP).

# What is a CBO?

If your flying a recreational drone, you must follow a CBO guideline.
They are not all the same, but the FAA expects you to be following a CBO guidelines and you must specify one if challenged by law enforcement or the FAA.
If you don't meet all the criteria of a designated CBO, then the FAA will consider you are Part 107 pilot and you will be required to have a pilots license
(that is your not a recreational pilot as specified in section 44809).

According to Section 44809, regardless of the size of your drone, a recreational drone pilot **must** be able to identify which CBO’s safety guidelines they are operating under should they be asked by an FAA representative or law enforcement officer. However, there is no need for any pilot to be a member of the CBO they are using as a basis for their safety guidelines. This only means that recreational drone pilots will not be forced to be a member of any CBO or to pay their membership dues.

As of November 2023, there are these
[FAA recognized Community Based Organizations (CBO)](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreationalfliers/faa-recognized-community-based-organizations)

# Where can I fly?

Fly like you stole it. Arrive prepared to fly, fly your drone, and then leave.

1. Check Federal rules (FAA)
   - Make sure you are not in controlled airspace
   - Make sure no Notice To Air Missions (NOTAM) are posted
   - Make sure no Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) are posted
   - National Parks
2. Check State laws
   - State Parks - most state and federal parks restrict drone flying
3. Check Local ordinances
   - Local Parks

# What does the rule on Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) require?

Drone pilots are expected to exercise good judgment in deciding whether they are still flying within VLOS. When in doubt, you should always go back to the fundamental purpose of the rule – is your drone and its surroundings visible enough so that you can maneuver away from any potential hazards?

The FAA states one specific situation in which a visual observer is necessary – when the drone is being operated in FPV. Flying in FPV does not satisfy VLOS requirements as it does not achieve the same level of situational awareness as having eyes on the drone. In such a situation, it is the duty of the visual observer to maintain VLOS and warn the drone pilot of any potential hazards.

Another restriction is that the drone pilot must be able to see the drone immediately once they have removed the FPV device. This is consistent with the requirement for the visual observer to be co-located with the pilot.

# FAA Regulations / Where Can I Fly?

The legal flying space and FAA direction can be confusing, and frankly, are evolving.

## What About FAA Registration?

Anyone flying a drone is responsible for flying within FAA guidelines and regulations.
That means it is up to you as a drone pilot to know the Rules of the Sky, and where it is and is not safe to fly.

There are 3 ways how drone pilots can operate their aircraft:

1. Operate a Standard Remote ID Drone. Such a drone has built-in Broadcast Remote ID functionality and can transmit identification and location information of the drone and control station according to the FAA requirements.
2. Pilots of other drones, older or custom, must use a Broadcast Remote ID device attached to the drone chassis or one that comes in the form of an upgrade integrated with the drone. These drones must be operated within a visual line of contact with their pilots (VLOS) and transmit Broadcast Remote ID according to FAA requirements.
3. UAS operations without Remote ID equipment are only allowed at [FAA-Recognized Identification Areas (FRIAs)][11]. Community-based organizations or schools run these areas.

No FAA or Remote ID Registration

You must use the paper (N-number) registration process if:

- recreational drones/unmanned aircraft that weigh 0.55 pounds (250 grams) or more and all drones flying under Part 107.

In the USA, March 16, 2024 (originally September 16, 2023):
All drone pilots must meet the operating requirements of Part 89. For most, this will mean:
Flying a drone with Remote ID capability (Standard Remote ID Drone)
Equipping a non-Standard Remote ID drone with an Remote ID broadcast module (add-on device)
Flying within FRIA (learn more about FRIA here)

The only exception is using non-commercial drones below 249 grams (0.55 lb). Remote ID for these “small” drones is only required if the drone is operated under rules that require registration, such as Part 107.

### What Must Be Done for FAA Compliance?

If you drone is less than 0.55 pounds, there are no regulations.
However, in order to fly drone over 0.55 pounds, there are FAA rules you must complie with.
The rule for operating unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones under 55 pounds
in the National Airspace System (NAS) is [14 CFR Part 107][07],
referred to as the Small UAS Rule.
To understand what FAA rules apply to your drone,
the FAA has an online tool "[What Kind of Drone Flyer Are You?][08]"
This tool points me to "[Fly under the rules for Recreational Flyers and Community Based Organizations][06]".

Part 107 Certification is for doing **anything** other that recreational flying.
If the orginal intent of the flight is anything other than recrational, then you must have a Part 107 Certification.

- [Should you get your FAA Part 107 Certificate? 12 Benefits to Consider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap96R6uZ_yE)

However, if you want to fly a drone for purely recreational purposes,
there is a limited statutory exception ("carve out") that provides a basic set of requirements.
What must you do:

- **Take the TRUST exam** -
  You must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate (TRUST) from the FAA.
  This certificate demonstrates that you understand the regulations, operating requirements, and procedures for safely flying drones.
- **Register your drone** -
- **Use Remote ID** -
- **Use the B4UFLY mobile app** -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmUryg09OKQ
Rule 1: Fly Strictly for Recreational Purposes (4:11)
Rule 2: Community Based Organization Guidelines (6:11)
Rule 3: Maintain Visual Line of Sight (7:06)
Rule 4: Do Not Interfere (8:21)
Rule 5/6: Get Authorization (8:54)
Rule 7: TRUST Certification (10:01)
Rule 8: Register Your Drone (11:06) .................... free registration stickers - https://pilotinstitute.com/free/
Rule 9: Don't Do Dangerous Operations (12:23)

That is it.
Below are some of details to address these three tasks.

### What is B4UFLY?

B4UFLY can notify a drone pilot if the FAA has restrict access to certain volumes of airspace
where drones or other aircraft are not permitted to fly without special permission.
Drone pilots should be familiar with:

- **Prohibited Areas** Prohibited area. A prohibited area is airspace within which no person may operate an aircraft without the permission of the using agency.
- **Restricted Areas** A restricted area is airspace within which the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject to restriction. Restricted areas are designated when determined necessary to confine or segregate activities considered hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft.
- **Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs)** TFRs are defined areas of airspace where the FAA limits aircraft operations because of:

  - Temporary hazardous conditions, such as a wildfire, hurricane, or chemical spill.
  - A security-related event, such as the United Nations General Assembly.
  - Other special situations, like VIP movement.

### What is LAANC?

The [Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC)][27]
is a collaboration between FAA and Industry.
It directly supports UAS integration into the airspace.
LAANC provides:

- Drone pilots with access to controlled airspace at or below 400 feet.
- Awareness of where pilots can and cannot fly.
- Air Traffic Professionals with visibility into where and when drones will operate.

There are now [many apps available that offer LAANC for free][27].

### What is Notify & Fly?

### Drone FAA Registration

Regulations DO apply to ALL model aircraft, even those under .55 pounds.
There is no lower weight limit exemption.
If your drone is between .55 pounds (250 grams) and 55 pounds (25 kilograms),
you must register your drone through the [FAA's Drone Zone][09],
and the registration number must be present on the outside of your drone.

### Commercial Drone Pilot Require Part 107 Certification

You do not need a drone license when you fly your drone strictly for fun as a hobby, recreational use (no side jobs or in-kind work allowed).
You’ll need an FAA-issued Part 107 Certificate to start piloting commercial drone flights for work or business.
In order to fly your drone under the FAA 's Small UAS Rule (Part 107), you must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA . This certificate demonstrates that you understand the regulations, operating requirements, and procedures for safely flying drones

### Remote ID Rules for Home-Built FPV Drones

A person designing or producing a Standard Remote ID drone or broadcast module for operation in U.S. airspace must show that they have met the requirements of the Remote ID rule by following an FAA-accepted Means of Compliance (MOC). A Means of Compliance describes the methods by which the person complies with the performance-based requirements for Remote ID.

- [Remote ID for Industry and Standards Bodies](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id/industry)

_Also, producers of a kit that contains all of the parts and instructions necessary for a drone must meet the production requirements of the Remote ID rule and submit a Declaration of Compliance. The person that puts together a "kit" drone does not need to submit a Declaration of Compliance if they are building it for their own recreation or education but must still meet the operational requirements of the Remote ID rule when flying it._

## How high can I Fly?

The rule that sets a maximum altitude of 400 feet for drone flight has been around for quite some time
yet has been quite contentious up until a few years ago.
The rule is based on the minimum cruising altitude of manned aircraft, which is 500 feet.

For commercial drone pilots licensed under Part 107,
there are ways to request authorization to fly above 400-foot around man made structures
There are no exceptions to the 400-foot rule for recreational drone pilots.

- [What Happens If You Fly A Drone Above 400 Feet?](https://pilotinstitute.com/drones-above-400-feet/)

## Where can I Fly?

FAA rules apply to the entire National Airspace System -- there is no such thing as "unregulated" airspace. Drone operators should be familiar with the difference between controlled and uncontrolled airspace, and where you can legally fly. Controlled airspace is found around some airports and at certain altitudes where air traffic controllers are actively communicating with, directing, and separating all air traffic. Other airspace is considered uncontrolled in the sense that air traffic controllers are not directing air traffic within its limits.

In general, you can only fly your drone in uncontrolled airspace below 400 feet above the ground (AGL).

If your drone doesn't have Remote ID capabilities, you’re not out of flying options completely.
You can fly a drone without Remote ID capabilities in a [FAA-Recognized Identification Area (FRIA)][11].
These are geographic areas (typically open fields and fairgrounds) that are recognized by the FAA where unmanned aircraft not equipped with Remote ID are still allowed to fly.
hese tend to be sites like fields owned by flying clubs, model aircraft groups or universities, so link up with a local group to help request more sites.
The FAA has a map through ArcGIS that can be a bit cumbersome to navigate. But, if you click the layer tab and select the boxes for “Recreational Flyer Fixed Sites,” they display quite nicely.
[See this][25].

FRIA applications are limited to [FAA-Recognized Community Based Organizations][12] educational institutions like primary and secondary schools, trade schools, colleges, universities,
and non-profit groups that are 501(c) or 501(a) in the Internal Revenue Code.

I live in the Washington DC area and the National Capital Region is governed by a Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA).
Specifically a 30-mile radius of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport,
which restricts all flights in the greater DC area.
The airspace around Washington, D.C. is more restricted than in any other part of the country. Rules put in place after the 9/11 attacks establish "national defense airspace" over the area and limit aircraft operations to those with an FAA and Transportation Security Administration authorization. Violators face stiff fines and criminal penalties.

The the DC area SFRA is divided into a 15-mile radius inner ring and a 30-mile radius outer ring.
Specifically, the FAA state.... [DC Area Prohibited & Restricted Airspace](https://www.faa.gov/uas/resources/community_engagement/no_drone_zone/dc)

1. Flying an unmanned aircraft within the 15-mile radius inner ring is prohibited without specific FAA authorization.
2. Flying a drone for recreational or non-recreational use between 15 and 30 miles from Washington, D.C. is allowed under these operating conditions:
   - Aircraft must weigh less than 55 lbs. (including any attachments such as a camera)
   - Aircraft must be registered and marked
   - Fly below 400 ft.
   - Fly within visual line-of-sight
   - Fly in clear weather conditions
   - Never fly near other aircraft

Fly at or below 400 feet in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace.
Note: Anyone flying a drone in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) is responsible for flying within the FAA guidelines and regulations. That means it is up to you as a drone pilot to know the rules: Where Can I Fly?

Class G airspace (uncontrolled) is that portion of airspace that has not been designated as Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E airspace. Rules governing VFR flight have been adopted to assist the pilot in meeting the responsibility to see and avoid other aircraft.
Class Golf (Class G) airspace is the uncontrolled "govern free" airspace which is void from Air Traffic Control (ATC) jurisdiction
Class G airspace supports both Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations within

but outside the 15-mile radius inner ring that prohibits drone flying without specific FAA authorization
You can fly a drone in the Class G airspace around the Leesburg airport.
Only airports located in Class A, B, C, D, & E2 controlled airspace require LAANC authorizations to operate near or around.

## What is a No Drone Zone?

The FAA uses the term "[No Drone Zone][10]" to help people identify areas where they cannot operate a drone or unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The operating restrictions for a No Drone Zone are specific to a particular location. You can find out if there are airspace restrictions where you are planning to fly using the B4UFLY mobile app.
