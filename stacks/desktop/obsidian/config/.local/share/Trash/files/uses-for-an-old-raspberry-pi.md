I have a one [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B][01] (32-bit, 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU, 1GB RAM)
and several [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+][02] (64-bit, 1.4GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU, 1GB RAM, WiFi & Bluetooth 4.2)

# Use for Old Raspberry Pi


## Pi Zero Platform for Grandmaster Clock
Grandmaster clocks receive UTC-based time information from an external time reference, most commonly a GNSS/GPS satellite source. The GNSS/GPS  receiver and a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) engine deliver a PTP service over Ethernet ports downstream to other clocks.

# Telescope
This is a working miniature observatory. It uses a Raspberry Pi computer for the brains, a Raspberry Pi RP2040 based microcontroller to control the movement, and the Raspberry Pi Hi Quality camera as the telescope.

# Print Server
If you have an old printer, like I do, why not transform it into a wireless printer that works with any device on your network?
you'll need a Wi-Fi-enabled Raspberry Pi such as the Raspberry Pi Zero W or its successor, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. You'll also need a USB cable to attach the printer to the Raspberry Pi. For initializing the server, you'll need CUPS (Common Unix Printing System), which allows you to print to both local and network printers.
