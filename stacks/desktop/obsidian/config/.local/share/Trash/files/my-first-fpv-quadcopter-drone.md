I got the itch to build & fly my own FPV quadcopter.
This itch came on me after I first built (and I continue to rebuild) a RC Car, which was in large part 3D printed.
It safe to say that my real desire was to 3D print & build a quadcopter,
but I felt it was too big of a first project.
The RC Car project is now done (well...not completely but it's time to move on),
I wanted to turn my attention to the quadcopter.
I looked into 3D printed the quadcopter plans but quickly concluded
that just tuning a quadcopter flight controller for flight, learning how to fly it myself,
and then fly the drone with minimal crashes will be a significant challenge in itself.
I needed a way to pickup some basic skills without over committing myself in time, effort, and money.

To address this, I choose to purchase a pre-built [Tiny Whoop][13] (also see [here][15]).
A Tiny Whoop is a small indoor FPV quadcopter featuring 31-40mm propellers,
protective propeller guards (some times constructed as prop ducts).
There are several tiny whoop sizes,
typically measure in prop size (31mm, 2 prop up to 45mm, 3 prop)
and/or frame size (65mm to 80mm), and/or weight (28g to 34g),
and/or battery size (usually operate on 1S or 2S LiPo batteries).

Tiny Whoops are easy-to-control FPV drones are perfect for indoor flying
but can also be flown outdoors when there is little wind.
Their ducts and light weight ensure safety and reduce damage upon crashes,
but agile enough to be fast & aerobatic in the outdoors.
I dare say that every serious FPV pilot has at least one Tiny Whoop at home,
with which he flies around indoors in winter.

An added benefit of the tiny whoops is their limited regulatory requirement because of their light weight.
The latest FAA rules requires all [Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)][17] to be [FAA registered][18]
and equipped with [RemoteID][16] for any aircraft of 250 grams or more.
Tiny whoops are well under the 250g threshold.
Never the less, the rule for **operating** any UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS) is [14 CFR Part 107][07],
referred to as the Small UAS Rule.
The bottom line is that while my tiny whoop doesn't require a RemoteID nor FAA registration,
you must take the [Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)][04] and carry proof of test passage when flying.

>**NOTE:** To understand what FAA rules apply to a light weight tiny whoop,
>the FAA has an online tool "[What Kind of Drone Flyer Are You?][08]"
>This tool points me to "[Fly under the rules for Recreational Flyers and Community Based Organizations][06]".
>This concerns the rules for recreational flying above the 250 gram threshold.

## What does PNP, BNF, RTF, and ARF Mean?
When you start shopping for FPV quadcopter equipment (e.x. Banggood, Amazon),
you will sometime encounter these abbreviations next to the product: PNP, BNF, RTF, ARF.
What this means and what exactly it means will be clarified here.

* **PNP – Plug and Play:**
Plug and Play actually sound quite good,
since in the computer world it means that we simply have to connect a device
and use it directly without having to install any other drivers.
In the FPV world it means something different.
Here it is a fully assemble FPV quadcopter, but lacks a LiPo battery and a Receiver.
You must paid attention to the protocol of the FPV video and remote control!
Also, “Plug and Play” is mostly should not be taken literally, hands on work will be required,
you might even need to do some soldering.
* **BNF – Bind and Fly:**
* **RTF – Ready to Fly:**
* **ARF – Almost Ready to Fly:**

* [PNP, BNF, RTF AND ARF](https://fpvracingdrone.org/from-a-to-z/pnp-bnf-rtf-arf/)


## My Quadcopter Selection
Tiny whoop's are often operated indoors,
and it is generally agreed that a 65mm tiny whoop is the best for indoor use.
Its crash resistant and least likely to break anything in your house.
If indoor racing is your objective, than a 65mm tiny whoop
(e.g. [Happymodel Mobula 6 1S 65mm](https://www.racedayquads.com/products/happymodel-bnf-mobula6-elrs-65mm-brushless-whoop-choose-rx)
[NewBeeDrone Hummingbird V3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzxtZYpigO0) might be best pick.

My main focus is on outdoor use, so more power and maneuverability is my goal.
I choose a slightly larger and more powerful quadcopter,
the [BetaFPV 80mm Meteor75 Pro 1S][24]
([checkout this video][41] and this [review][23]).
It has analog FPV video system ([C03 FPV camera](https://betafpv.com/products/c03-fpv-micro-camera),
[M03 5.8GHz 350mW VTX](https://betafpv.com/products/m03-25-350mw-5-8g-vtx)),
[45mm (1.77 inches) 3-Blade 1.5mm shaft propellers](https://betafpv.com/collections/40mm-propellers/products/gemfan-45mm-2-blade-3-blade-propellers-1-5mm-shaft-4pcs?variant=40100902273158),

## Additional Equipment
To make my tiny whoop Meteor75 Pro quadcopter usable,
I need additional equipment and tools.
Primarily, this includes:

* Radio Controller - [RadioMaster Boxer](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/collections/boxer-1/products/boxer-radio-controller-m2)
    adioadioMaster](<https://www.radiomasterrc.com/>)

* [Making Whoops FLY BETTER | w/ the BETAFPV Meteor 75 PRO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfDMKg0XJ14)

Conspicuously absent from this list are goggles ... "What's the point of [first person video (FPV)][20]", you say?!
There are hard choose and compromises that must be made with the selection of goggles.
Not least of which is the desire to pick goggles suitable for future (aka unknown) projects.
Getting a good pair of feature rich, quality goggles is a must, but given their expense, I don't want to make a hasty decision.
I'm going to go without goggles for now and focus on learn how to fly and tune a quadcopter.
This might inform me on what I ultimate want from my goggles,
but in any event, I'm taking the time to make sure I fell good about what how I'm spending my money.


## Anticipated Tuning and Modifications
Learn how to fly before doing Betaflight tuning.  The default values in Betaflight should be good enough for initial learnings about flying.

I got several ideas from these sources about changes I would like to consider:

# Prepare Quadcopter for First Flight
The [BetaFPV 80mm Meteor75 Pro 1S][24] comes with a [QR code link][30] to website to get you going for your first flight.
BetaFPV also provides on the [F4 1S 5A AIO Brushless Flight Controller (aka BETAFPVF411)][25] a great deal of information to get you started.

* Built-in ExpressLRS 2.4G receiver, which can be updated via WiFi or Betaflight serial passthrough.
* Built-in an 8MB flash memory chip dedicated to Blackbox logging, useful for tuning and troubleshooting.


## Backup Everything
In this section, I will outline how to do a complete backup to protect yourself from a catastrophic data or software lose of
your radio controller, flight controller, electronic speed controller, or your goggles.
In reality, only theses things you have created/configure in the radio controller and flight controller will be saved.
Any platform level software can always be download from the cloud.


#### Step 1: Backup Transmitter (RadioMaster Boxer) - DONE
My [RadioMaster Boxer][26] transmitter has a [EdgeTX][27] operating system with a [ExpressLRS][28] radio.
[EdgeTX Companion][29] is a computer program that allows you to connect to your
EdgeTx radio via USB and perform backups, modifications, etc. using your laptop/desktop.
We'll use it here to do a backup:

1. Turn on RadioMaster Boxer **before** connecting it with a USB cable
2. Connect your desktop computer to the RadioMaster Boxer via USB-C port on top
3. Make sure you are in USB mode, that is, select **USB Storage (SD)** in the Boxer menu. This makes Boxer appears as a hard drive on your computer
4. Using the EdgeTX Companion, select the button in the left-hand menu that is titled **Read Models and Settings From Radio**.
Save the Models & Settings on your computer (e.g. directory `~/FPV-Flying/Backups/RadioMaster-Boxer/`)
via the **Save** button the the top menu with an identifiable name (e.g. `EdgeTX-settings-backup-10-30-2023.etx`)
5.Using the EdgeTX Companion, select the button in the left-hand menu that is titled **Read Firmware From Radio**.
Save the firmware on your computer via the **Save** button with an identifiable name (e.g. `EdgeTX-firmware-backup-10-30-2023.bin`)
**Doesn't Work Because of `dfu-util` Problem** - May not be needed if you copy the SD-Card as shown below.
6. As an extra measure, using your file management tool, copy the entire SD-card from the Boxer to you backup folder.

* [EdgeTX Companion Backup & Restore Models & Radio Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW7N0DmKqLw)
* [Looking for EdgeTX Companion? See this link](https://edgetx.org/getedgetx/)


#### Step 2: Backup Flight Controller (FC) - DONE
[Betaflight Configurator][14] can help with the backup of the flight controllers (FC) firmware and settings.

1. Via a USB cable, connect your flight controller to you desktop computer.
2. Start Betaflight Configurator via icon in the lanucher (or on the commandline via `/opt/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/`).
3. Click on the large **Connect** button on the top right.
3. On the left side menu column of Betaflight Configurator, select the **Presets** icon, which, looks like a magic wand.
4. To backup the FC configuration, go to the **Presets** tab.
There you have the button **Save backup**.
Press this button and place the backup file in `~/FPV-Flying/Backups/Meteor75-Pro/`.
(**NOTE:** The result is the same as entering `diff all` in **CLI**).

To restore this configuration, simply use the **Load backup** button on the **Presets** tab.

If you need to restore the FC firmware,
you can us Betaflight Configurator to retreve and restore it.
You'll need the version number and that can be found in the configuration file you just backed up.
To get the Betaflight firmware version number, just do the following:

```bash
# get the firmware version number
grep -i betaflight BTFL_cli_backup_*.txt
```

To restore this firmware, click the large **Update Firmware** button on the top right and follow the instructions.

* [Betaflight CLI | How to Restore Rotor Riot Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4AjJi8sUhM)


#### Step 3: Backup Quadcopter Radio (ExpressLRS) - DONE
There is really **no way to backup the ExpressLRS radio software** on the quadcopter.
The best you can do is reflash it with the version you have installed.
So **what is shown here is the reflashing process**.

I'm going to show the procedure for my [BetaFPV 80mm Meteor75 Pro 1S][24].
For a different quadcopter, the setup will change, particullary in the **Target** section:

1. Plug ina a USB cable from your flight controller to your computer, but do **NOT** connect to betaflight configurator.
Instant execute the ExpressLRS Configurator via icon in the lanucher (or on the commandline via `expresslrs-configurator`).
2. Make sure your on the **OFFICAL RELEASES** tab.
3. Within the **Firmware version** section, pick from the menu the release you wish to use ("3.3.0" in my case).
**NOTE: The both your quadcopter and the controller radio must be using the same version.**
4. Within **TARGET** **Device category** select "BETAFPV 2.4GHz" from the menu.
5. Within **TARGET** **Device** select "BETAFPV 2.4GHz AIO RX" from the menu.
1. Within **Flashing Method** section, use the **BetaflightPassthrough** option in ExpressLRS Configurator.
1. Within the **Device options** section, select **Standard mode**.
Check **REGULATORY_DOMAIN_ISM_2400**, **BINDING_PHRASE** (I use my name as the binding phrase), and **LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION**.
**NOTE: The both your quadcopter and the controller radio must be using the same binding phrase.**
1. Within the **Actions** section, select the serial device driver that your quadcopter has been assigned (typically `/dev/ttyACM0`).
1. Click the **FLASH** button.

Sources:

* [ExpressLRS definitive getting started guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Hg2f7RL1A)


#### Step 4: Backup RadioMaster Boxer Radio (ExpressLRS) - DONE (sort-of)
Like the quadcopter,
there is really **no way to backup the ExpressLRS radio software** on the RadioMaster Boxer radio.
You'll use the same reflashing proceedure outline above except you'll be using
**RadioMaster 2.4 GHZ** and **RadioMaster Boxer Internal 2.4GHz TX** in the **Target** section.


#### Step 5: Backup Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) - DONE (sort-of)
Like the ExpressLRS examples, there is really **no way to backup the ECS software** on the quadcopter.
The best you can do is reflash the ESC with the [ESC-Configurator][33].


#### Step 6: Backup Goggles



------



#### Step X: Charge Batteries - DONE
Make sure to charge a sutable 1S LiPo battery (regular or high voltage).
I'm using [BetaFPV's BT2.0 550mAh 1S Batteries][31], a high voltage battery, on the Meteor75 Pro.

* Specification for BetaFPV BT2.0 550mAh 1S Battery
  * **Capacity:** 550mAh
  * **Rate:** 40C (continuous) / 80C (burst)
  * **Voltage:** 3.8V
  * **Battery type：LiHv (3.8~4.35V)
  * **Dimension:** 69.5*16.2*6.5mm
  * **Connector:** BT2.0 connector
  * **Weight:** 13.99g
* Charging for BT2.0 550mAh 1S Battery
  * **Charging Voltage & Current:** 4.35V at 0.5A
  * **Fully Charged:** This battry is considered fully charged when its at 4.35V
  * **Storage Charge:** When storing the battery, its voltage should be 3.85V

I'm using the [VIFLY WhoopStor 3 1S LiPo Battery Storage Charger and Discharger][32].
Setting that you should use are:

* Storage Charge for regular LiPo: 3.80V
* Storage Charge for high voltage LiPo: 3.85V
* Full Charge for regular LiPo: 4.20V
* Full Charge for high voltage LiPo: 4.35V

>**NOTE:** For the vast majority of LiPos, the Charge Rate is 1C. So for our 550mAh battery, 0.55Ah / 1C = 0.55A
>A 1S LiPo cell should NEVER be discharged below 3.0V.
>Discharging a LiPo cell lower than 3.0V causes a usually permanent degradation of the cell's ability to absorb and retain a charge.

#### Step X: Prepare Radio Transmitter (RadioMaster Boxer)
See `getting-started-with-radiomaster-boxer.md`


#### Step X: Prepare Flight Controller
see `getting-started-with-betaflight.md`


#### Step X: Updating & Binding ELRS Reciver to RadioMaster Transmitter
The flight controller Come with a built-in ExpressLRS 2.4G receiver,
which can be updated via WiFi or Betaflight serial passthrough.
It use Crossfire serial protocol (CRSF protocol) to communicate between the receiver and the flight controller board.

The [F4 1S 5A AIO Brushless Flight Controller (aka BETAFPVF411)][25]
features the Serial ELRS 2.4G (instead of SPI ELRS 2.4G).
Serial ELRS 2.4G RX uses the Crossfire serial protocol (CRSF protocol) to communicate between the RX and the FC board.
So the Serial ELRS 2.4G RX is available to support upgrading to ELRS V3.0 with no need to flash Betaflight FC firmware.

First, lets check if the flight controller **is not** a SPI reciever.
To do this, connect your quadcopter to Betaflight:

1. Click on the **Receiver** tab and check **Receiver Mode** on the upper right. You should see **Serial (via UART)** in the pulldown menu.
You should also see **CRSF** in the **Serial Reciever Provider** pulldown menu.
2. Now shutdown Betaflight Configurator and unplug the quadcopter from your computer.

So if you validated your using "Serial (via UART)" and **not** **SPI**,
the firmware update & binding process below should work for you.
We'll now use `expresslrs-configurator` and the binding phrase established for my RadioMaster Boxer.
This will allow the quadcopter and the Boxer to automatically bind when turned on.

1. Plug in your flight controller to your computer, but do **NOT** connect to betaflight configurator.
1. Execute `expresslrs-configurator`
1. Within **TARGET** **Device category** select "BETAFPV 2.4GHz" from the menu.
1. Within **TARGET** **Device** select "BETAFPV 2.4GHz AIO RX" from the menu.
1. Flash using the BetaflightPassthrough option in ExpressLRS Configurator.

# Optical Flow LIDAR Sensor
This is a sensor to enable position hold and altitude hold on a drone.
What Is Optical Flow? Optical flow is the distribution of the apparent velocities of objects in an image. By estimating optical flow between video frames, you can measure the velocities of objects in the video.

# Radio Controller
Protocols in FPV can be divided into 3 groups:

```
_________                ____________                _____________________                 _______
| Radio |----------------| Receiver |----------------| Flight Controller |-----------------| ESC |
---------                ------------                ---------------------                 -------
           TX Protocols                RX Protocols                          ESC Protocols


Goggles ----------------- Reciever --------------------- Transmitter --------------------- Camera
```

* TX Protocols – communication between radio transmitter (TX) and radio receiver (RX)
* RX Protocols – communication between radio receiver (RX) and flight controller (FC)
* ESC Protocols – communication between FC and ESC

## Radio Control Link Protocols
What are all the common radio control (RC) protocols in FPV,
and how they fit into the communication system in an FPV drone,
and what their differences are.

900 MHz - bandwidth is small so 5 to 8 pilots in the air
2.4 GHz - bandwidth is much larger so it can support 50 ... where you want to be


* ACCST - one of the first and showing its age
* ACCESS - FrSky ecosystem only
* FrSky R9 - 900MHz, FrSky ecosystem only, but R9 hardware will run ExpressLRS
* TBS Crossfire - 900MHz and up to 2 Watts, outstanding range, stable and good performance but not the best latency
* Ghost - 2.4 GHz, you can trade-off range & latency, TBS Crossfire range is superior
* TBS Tracer - 2.4 GHz, TBS competitive response to Ghost, excellent latency at the expense of range so great for racers
* [ExpressLRS](https://www.expresslrs.org/) - 900 MHz & 2.4 GHz, best combination of range & latency

* [FPV Protocols Explained (CRSF, SBUS, DSHOT, ACCST, PPM, PWM and more)](https://oscarliang.com/rc-protocols/)


### ExpressLRS
[ExpressLRS (ELRS)](https://www.expresslrs.org/) is an open source project focusing on developing a radio control (RC) link. The link is primarly designed for first-person view (FPV) crafts (e.g Multicopters, Planes). ELRS aims to provide the best completely open source, high refresh radio control link, minimising latency while maximising range. A vast range of hardware in both 900 Mhz and 2.4 GHz frequencies is available.

ExpressLRS vs FrSky

ExpressLRS is an open source,  high performance, low latency long range link.

### Whats the Differance between ELRS vs 4-in-1 vs MPM CC2500?
In the RadioMaster lineup, you can get 3 different modules: Ranger, Micro, Nano.
The Ranger and Micro fit into a JR Bay.
A Nano fits into a Nano Bay.

# Drones
Drones are defined as "an unmanned aircraft or ship guided by remote control or onboard computers",
and have been around for over [100 hundred years][01].
These remote-controlled flying crafts have become an increasingly popular project to work on,
including building and racing them.
[FPV Drone Racing][02] has become a popular sport and it even has its own league.
The Drone Racing League was created in 2015 and features racing with custom-built drones that traveling over 100 MPH.


## Should I Build or Buy?
For me, there is an obvious choose.
I want to build my drone for the challenge, learning opportunity, and maximum flexibility of design.


## What is Your Mission?
I have no specific task I want my drone to perform,
at least not this version.
I just want the challenge and learn some new things.
I do have some very loose ideas about what I may do next,
but it requires this build to go successfully so I can build on it.

I don't want a drone that has significant lifting capacity.
The more you can lift, the more the weight goes up, and more expensive the components used to build it.
Never the less, out fit it with add-on latter,
like a camera, sensors, or additional communication capabilities would be nice.
So having a drone design that can take on more weight is something to consider.

### What Size Drone?
Some people decide that buying a Whoop class drone ( something small enough to fit in the palm of your hand) is the best way to get started due to their size, ability to survive crashes, and can be flown indoors.

### What is a Topothpick Drone?
Toothpick drones are essentially brushless tiny whoops on stretched out frames. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes but in general, they are 100-125 mm in size.
Toothpick class quads are ultra-light weights that have an AUW of under 100g.

## Removing Propellers
The [PropPopper](https://www.tinywhoop.com/products/prop-popper)
is a tiny tapered fork that gently slides between the prop and the motor bell.
A lot of the time this is enough to loosen the prop from the shaft,
but for propellers that have a hole thru the top,
you can use the tiny plunger to push the motor shaft down and pop the prop right off!

# Flight Controller
A flight controller, or “FC”, is like the brain of an FPV drone.
It’s a circuit board equipped with sensors that detect the drone’s movements and user commands.
With this information, the FC adjusts the speed of the motors to move the drone in the desired direction.

All flight controllers have basic sensors like gyroscopes (gyro) and accelerometers (acc), while others may include other sensors such as barometric pressure sensors (barometer) and compasses (magnetometer).

A flight controller is one of the most important components in a FPV drone.
It’s responsible for stabilizing the aircraft, ensuring precise flight manoeuvres, and providing data to the pilot.

## Autonomous Flight and Obstacle Avoidance
Predicted GPS (P-GPS) is a form of assistance that reduces the Time to First Fix (TTFF), the time needed by a GNSS module to estimate its position.
A form of assistance provided to devices trying to obtain a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) fix, where the device can download up to two weeks of predicted satellite Ephemerides data. It enables devices to determine the exact orbital location of the satellite without connecting to the network every two hours with a trade-off of reduced accuracy of the calculated position over time. It is available through nRF Cloud.
