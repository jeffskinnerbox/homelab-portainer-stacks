# Lineman's Handset / Butt Set
A lineman's handset is a special type of telephone used by technicians for installing and testing local loop telephone lines. It is also called a test set, butt set, or buttinski.
Older Telephone linemen also referred to the Buttset as a "Goat".
A butt set can be connected wherever there is a line appearance—anywhere the wires are accessible. Inside the central office, this would be at a main or intermediate distribution frame. For outside plant, this would include any serving area interface, such as a cross-connect box or aerial splice enclosure. At subscriber sites (e.g., residence), this could be inside or behind the housing of a modular connector, or at the network interface.
