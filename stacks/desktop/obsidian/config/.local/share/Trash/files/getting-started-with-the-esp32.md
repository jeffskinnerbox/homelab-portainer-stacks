# ESP-ZeroCode
The first ESP-ZeroCode modules will be offered with either ESP32-C3 (aka ESP8685) or ESP32-C2 (aka ESP8684) WiFi & BLE RISC-V SoCs, or ESP32-H2 802.15.4 & BLE RISC-V microcontroller, and ships with a Matter compatible firmware that enables ‚Äúnear-zero investment in development‚Äù. Not it‚Äôs not entirely clear whether those are zero-code or just ‚Äúlittle-code‚Äù (better known as low code) programming devices

The Matter protocol is intended to solve the problem of interoperability for smart home devices. It securely and robustly connects various smart devices with each other across ecosystems, regardless of the manufacturer.

Matter is an application layer protocol that abstracts the underlying connectivity technologies such as Wi-Fi, Thread and Bluetooth LE.

By using a common software stack, device manufacturers who build with Matter will be able to support various smart home ecosystems and voice services. Smart home users will be able to buy any Matter-certified device regardless of their platform of choice.

# ESP32-S2
ESP32-S2 only has a single 32-bit Xtensa core, reduced RAM and ROM,
and WiFi only (no Bluetooth) ‚Äî compared to the traditional ESP32.
These tradeoffs mean the S2 draws significantly less power consumption, especially while active.

The dual-core ESP32-S3 with a clock of 240 MHz is similar to the original and, unlike the S2, has Bluetooth 5 (LE) support. In addition, it has instructions specific to neural networks and signal processing which is helpful in edge machine learning applications.
Other key differences between ESP32-S3 and ESP32 include support for larger capacity and higher-speed SPI flash and PSRAM chips, a few more I/O pints, more security features, a lack of Ethernet MAC, and support for Bluetooth LE 5.0 connectivity with long-range and 2Mbps transfer support.

# ESP32-C3
When Esspresif introduced the ESP32-C3, it was their first SOM based entirely on the RISC-V architecture. It is a low-cost, single-core SOM with WiFi and Bluetooth support.

The new ‚ÄúC3‚Äù variant has a single 160 MHz RISC-V core that out-performs the ESP8266, and at the same time includes most of the peripheral set of an ESP32. While RAM often ends up scarce on an ESP8266 with around 40 kB or so, the ESP32-C3 sports 400 kB of RAM, and manages to keep it all running while burning less power. Like the ESP32, it has Bluetooth LE 5.0 in addition to WiFi.

ESP32-C3 is a single-core WiFi and Bluetooth 5 (LE) microcontroller SoC, based on the open-source RISC-V architecture for secure IoT applications. It strikes the right balance of power, I/O capabilities and security, thus offering the optimal cost-effective solution for connected devices.

# Using Both ESP32 Cores
The ESP32 comes with 2 Xtensa 32-bit LX6 microprocessors: core 0 and core 1.
So, it is dual core.
When we run code on Arduino IDE, by default, it runs on core 1.
What if I wanted to keep everything WiFi related to core0,
while updating the displays was handled by core1,
and make your ESP32 multitasking?
