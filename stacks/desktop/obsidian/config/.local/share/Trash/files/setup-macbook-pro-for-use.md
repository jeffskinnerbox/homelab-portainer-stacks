# How to Install Apps
There are all kinds of apps available for your Mac:
from social media and games to password security and task management; the options are limitless.
There are two main ways of downloading and installing apps on your computer:

* **Install apps from the Mac App Store -**
This is the first place to look for your apps.
[Apple’s App Store][01] offers a variety of applications.
that have been screened for safety, reliability, and performance.
Plus, the App Store combines downloading and installing an app into one easy step.
* **Install apps on your Mac from the Web -**

## From Inside the Mac App Store
The App Store combines downloading and installing an app into one easy step.

1. The App Store icon is at the bottom of the screen.
Search for and locate the app you’d like to download in the Mac App Store.
2. Click on the grey price icon located just below the app’s rating. If the app is free, this button will say **Get**.
3. Click on the green **Install** button. You may be asked to enter your Apple ID and password.

That’s it! Your app should install quickly and be ready to use.
You can find it in the Applications folder in Finder.

## From Outside the Mac App Store
Downloading an app from the web is just a little more involved than using the App Store.

* If the file you’ve downloaded ends with the extension `.zip`,
double-click the file to unzip it. The files should be ready to use.

* If the file ends with the extension `.dmg`, you’ll need to do the following:
1. Open **Finder** from the bottom left of your Mac’s Dock.
2. Go to your **Downloads** folder found on the left menu.
3. Double-click the file you downloaded.
4. If an error message pops up stating that the program “can’t be opened because it wasn’t downloaded from the Mac App Store,”
click the **Apple Icon** button at the top left, click **System Settings...**, click **Security & Privacy**.
In the **Security** section, click the **Allow** to proceed with the installation.
5. Double-click the file and install the app following the instructions.
6. The app will appear in the Applications folder in **Finder**.
Once the app has been installed, you can uninstall the `.dmg` file
by clicking the eject (⏏) button next to the app’s name in **Finder**.

You can add an application to your Dock by dragging its icon from the Applications folder in **Finder** to your Dock.
