# TinyGS
TinyGS is an open network of Ground Stations distributed around the world to receive and operate LoRa satellites, weather probes and other flying objects, using cheap and versatile modules.
This project is based on ESP32 boards and currently it is compatible with sx126x and sx127x LoRa módules but we plan to support more radio módules in the future.

# Swarm Technologies
The Swarm is a tiny radio that can talk bi-directionally with small satellites in low Earth orbit.
The little unit is made to mount on a PCB, can control its power consumption,
and talks to your system via a standard 3.3V UART connection.
It does, however, require a small antenna and maybe even a smaller antenna for its GPS module.
