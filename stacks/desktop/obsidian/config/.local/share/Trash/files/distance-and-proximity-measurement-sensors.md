# Sensor Array / Synthetic Sensor
The [Persistent Aquatic Living Sensors (PALS) program](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-02-02)
envisions using the natural sensing capabilities of marine organisms to detect
the presence of underwater vehicles in strategic waters such as straits and littoral regions.
PALS technology would register organisms’ responses to target stimuli,
process and distill that information, and relay it to remote end users.
