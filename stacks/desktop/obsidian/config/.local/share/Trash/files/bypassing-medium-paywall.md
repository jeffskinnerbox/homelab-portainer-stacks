A paywall is a method of restricting access to content unless you pay for a subscription.
In-exchange, writers could receive a share of the membership fee paid by the reader.
Beginning in 2017, [Medium.com][01] doesn't allow you to read more than 3 articles per month for free.

People have identified ways around this paywall.
Some examples are:

* [Bypassing the Medium Paywall][02]
* [Chrome Extension: Unlimited Medium][03]

The first gives additional access by clearing cookies left behind by Medium.
By clearing the cookies, your limit will reset so you can read again 3 articles.
So your process is as follows:

1. Start reading Medium article freely without being blocked.
2. Once you reach the monthly limit, click on the 'Unlimited Medium' icon in your browser menu bar
3. Repeat

The second is what I use, and it works more reliably for me than the first.
Its a Chrome browser extension that gives me a button that I press when ever Medium blocks my access.
Its very easy to install, just follow the instruction [here][03].
