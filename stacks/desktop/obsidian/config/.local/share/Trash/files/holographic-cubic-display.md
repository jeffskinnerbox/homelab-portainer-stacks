July of 2024, I purchased something titled
["Arduino creative custom office wifi networking weather forecast weather cloud clock projection transparent small TV"][01].
It was a very misleading description & picture
(it was a glass cube without the electronics ... sooo typical of Aliexpress)
but it was only $14 (with shipping!) and I wanted to try out the device and see it in operation.
It promised to create a [3D optical effect within a small 25.5mm cube][02].
I figured that if it created a dramatic effect, I would consider scaling it up.

At its core, it created a famous optical effect called the [Pepper's Ghost Illusion][03].
Its an illusion of a 3D object, suspended in space, against a transparent backdrop.
You'll find a great deal of information on the Web concerning the Pepper's Ghost Illusion.
Here are some Pepper's Ghost history & DIY displays:

# Some Definitions

* **Spectroscopy** is the study of the absorption and emission of light and other radiation by matter.
It involves the splitting of light (or more precisely electromagnetic radiation)
into its constituent wavelengths (a spectrum),
which is done in much the same way as a prism splits light into a rainbow of colours.
* The word **Spectroscopic** is an adjective, and concerns the process of forming and looking at spectra with a spectroscope.
* **Holography**  is a technique that enables a wavefront to be recorded and later reconstructed.
It is best known as a method of generating three-dimensional images, and has a wide range of other uses, including data storage, microscopy, and interferometry.
In principle, it is possible to make a hologram for any type of wave.
* **Hologram**
* **Holographic**
* **Optical Prism**
* **Beam Splitter**
* A **Volumetric Display** device is a display device that forms a visual representation of an object in three physical dimensions,
as opposed to the planar image of traditional screens that simulate depth through a number of different visual effects.
