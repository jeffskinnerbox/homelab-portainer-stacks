Radar is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects.

A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed.

The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for "RAdio Detection And Ranging".
