A phase-locked loop or phase lock loop (PLL) is a control system that generates an output signal
whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal.
Keeping the input and output phase in lock step also implies keeping the input and output frequencies the same.
Consequently, in addition to synchronizing signals, a phase-locked loop can track an input frequency,
or it can generate a frequency that is a multiple of the input frequency.
These properties are used for computer clock synchronization, demodulation, and frequency synthesis.

There are several different types; the simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator
and a phase detector in a feedback loop.
The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase of that signal
with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting the oscillator to keep the phases matched.
