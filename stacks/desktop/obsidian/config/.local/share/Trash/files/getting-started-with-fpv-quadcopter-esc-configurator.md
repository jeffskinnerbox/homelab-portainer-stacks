[ESC-Configurator][01] is an experimental web app to configure ESC firmware online.
Its an open source project ([GitHubw site stylesuxx/esc-configurator][02], [additional documentation][03])
Currently the following firmware are supported:
[BLHeli_S](https://github.com/bitdump/BLHeli),
[Bluejay](https://github.com/bird-sanctuary/bluejay),
[AM32](https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware).

## So What is an ESC?
Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC) are responsible for controlling the speed of motors in an FPV drone.
The ESC receives throttle signals from the flight controller and drives the brushless motor at the desired speed.
Theyâ€™re powered by direct current (DC) from your LiPo battery
and take motor signals from the flight controller, providing three-phase alternating current to power the motor.

ESC firmware is the software that runs on every ESC.
It determines what ESC settings you can change, which protocols are supported,
and what configuration interface can be used.
The firmware that an ESC is allowed to use depends on the hardware.
Some of the most prevalent ESC firmwares are:
BLHeli_S, BLHeli_32, AM32, Bluejay.

BLHeli has taken over the market due its more user-friendly interface and consistent development.
Nowadays, all ESCâ€™s come with firmware pre-installed, most commonly BLHeli_S or BLHeli_32 depending on the hardware.
Anyway this should be clearly stated in the product description.

For BLHeli_S ESC, you can optionally flash Bluejay firmware to unlock certain features that are only available on BLHeli_32 ESC,
such as bi-directional DShot and custom startup sound.
It truly brings the performance to the level of the more expensive BLHeli_32 ESC.

# Install ESC-Configurator
[ESC-Configurator][01] is a website but I want to also execute it from the Ubuntu/Gnome launcher.
to do this,



```bash

```
