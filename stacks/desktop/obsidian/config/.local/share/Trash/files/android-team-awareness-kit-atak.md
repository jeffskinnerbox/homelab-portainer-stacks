What is a Tactical Assault Kit (TAK)?
The Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK), for civilian use,
or Android Tactical Assault Kit (also ATAK), for military use,
is a suite of software that provides geospatial information
and allows user collaboration over geography.
ATAK was originally developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)
and is now maintained by the TAK Product Center (TPC).
