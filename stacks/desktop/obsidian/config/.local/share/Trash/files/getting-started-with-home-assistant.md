# Smart Home / IoT Server Software Platform
I got plans for several standard home sensors (e.g. water sensors),
not so standard sensors (e.g. people detecting via smart phone RF exhaust),
and some novel status display methods (e.g. scrolling display critical events).
These edge devices all require a operating environment where they can be
provisioned, monitored, controlled, persistent data storage, etc.

So I need :

* Smart Home / IoT Server
* Smart Home / IoT Platform
* Smart Home / IoT Device Gateway
* Smart Home / IoT Devices

For the server I have selected the ever popular Raspberry Pi, which means I'm hosting my own solution.
I could choose one of the may cloud providers
([Samsung SmartThings][11], [Mozilla IoT][12], [AWS Alexa][13],
[Google's Cloud IoT Core][14], [Microsoft Azure IoT][15], etc.)
but I don't think any of them will provide me the privacy, control, or extensibility I will ultimately desire.

For the platform, which will operate on the server,
I read multiple reviews and quickly restrict my attention to [Home Assistant][07] or [OpenHAB][08]
and choose Home Assistant based in part on [SmartHome University's evaluation][18] of the two options
([here][19] is another informative review).
These platforms claim to be vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home.
There are others with a similar bent
(e.g [Calaos][21], [Domoticz][22], [MisterHouse][23], [OpenMotics][24], [OpenNetHome][25], etc.)
but Home Assistant and OpenHAB have captured the most attention.

For the device gateway, assuming I need it,
at this moment I would be using a [Raspberry Pi with EdgeX Foundry][09],
EdgeX Foundry is part of [LF Edge][10],
a portfolio (aka collection of projects or umbrella, if you prefer) for Linux based IoT solutions.
But I want to give serious consideration to alternatives like
[Mozilla WebThings][12] and [Eclipse ThingWeb][16],
which are both an implementations of the ["Web of Things" standard from the W3C][17].


# Smart Home / IoT Server Hardware Platform
The next critical decision is what hardware do I use?
After a bit of research,
I concluded I want to use the most capable Raspberry Pi,
booting from a fast and beefy SSD drive,
housed in a highly functional case.
For me, this boils down to:

* The compute platform is the [Raspberry Pi 4][01] with 4GB of memory.
The speed and performance of the Raspberry Pi 4 is a step up from earlier models,
enabling a complete desktop experience.
The Raspberry Pi 4 also now supports [native USB boot without SD card][06].
This can give you faster boots, faster disk drive, and higher reliability.
* I'm using the [Samsung 860 EVO SSD 500GB - M.2 SATA Internal Solid State Drive][02].
Why SSD? They are about 10 times faster than SD Card,
as low as twice the price of SDs and should be much more reliable.
SDs are well suited to cameras but will tend to fail because computers
often over-writing the same location wearing down the memory.
* The [well-regarded][38] and stylish [Argon ONE M.2 Case for Raspberry Pi 4][03] which supports,
or should I say the Raspberry Pi 4 supports,
the [USB Attached SCSI Protocol (UASP)][04].
This means you can maximize the transfer speeds
of your M.2 SATA Drive which comes with built-in adapter board for the M.2 SSD.
* You can also [configure the Argon case fan and power button][05] for you needs
(e.g. temperature selectable multi-speed fan & power switch supporting safe shutdown and hard reboot).
And to top it off, the GPIO pins are still easily accessible but smartly hidden.

# Preparing the Raspberry Pi SD Card
In this section, we will prepare SD-Card for first boot.
This first boot will be from a SD Card on the Raspberry Pi,
despite the fact that the [Argon ONE M.2 Case for Raspberry Pi 4][20]
with a M.2 SATA SSD is our ultimate target configuration.


#### Step 1: Download Raspberry Pi Image - DONE
Before you can load a copy of the latest Raspberry Pi image onto your micro SD Card,
you must first download the official [Raspberry Pi 4][30] operating system, [Raspberry Pi OS][31].
The download site also lists a check sum for the download file.
(In my case, I down loaded the Raspberry 4 OS file to `/home/jeff/Downloads/RPi-OS`.)
Check whether the file has been changed from its original state
by checking its digital signature (SHA1 hash value).

```bash
# change director to temp storage
cd ~/Downloads/RPi-OS

# download raspberry pi os (full image with with desktop)
wget https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_full_armhf/images/raspios_full_armhf-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.zip

# validate file is not corrupted via check of digital signature
# at https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/
$ sha256sum /home/jeff/Downloads/RPi-OS/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.zip
84a711d9ff4c295711a40af43fea38893a20b3b087a48370d8fb926fb541faf5  /home/jeff/Downloads/RPi-OS/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.zip
```

Next you need to unzip the file to retrieve the Linux image file:

```bash
# move to the directory with the download
cd /home/jeff/Downloads/RPi-OS

# unzip the raspberry pi os
unzip 2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.zip

# check the size of the image, note that its over 8G
$ ls -l
total 11347536
-rw-r--r-- 1 jeff jeff 8602517504 May  7 11:23 2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jeff jeff 3005999855 May  7 11:35 2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.zip

# remove the zip file
rm 2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.zip
```


#### Step 2: Write Raspberry Pi Image to SD Card - DONE
Next using Linux, you have to copied the Raspberry OS image onto the SD card mounted to your system.
I'll be using the [Rocketek 11-in-1 4 Slots USB 3.0 Memory Card Reader][32] to create my SD Card.
Make sure to [choose a reputable SD Card][33] from [here][34], don't go cheap.
**NOTE:** Additionally important for this project is to **use a 16G or 32G SD Card**
since we'll be using the SD Card to copy and then transport the RPi image to the M.2 SSD.

When using your card reader,
you'll need to know the device name of the reader.
The easiest way to find this is just unplug your card reader from the USB port,
run `df -h`, then plug it back in, and run `df -h` again.

```bash
# with the SD card reader unplugged
df -h

# with the SD card reader plugged in USB
$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
 .
 .
 .
/dev/sdj1        30G   32K   30G   1% /media/jeff/3130-3833
```

Note that in my example above, the new device is `/dev/sdj1`.
The last part (the number 1) is the partition number
but we want to write to the whole SD card, not just one partition.
Therefore you need to remove that part when creating the image.
With this information, and know the location of the Raspbian image and
where we need to write the Raspberry OS image to the SD Card.

```bash
# go to directory with the RPi image
cd /home/jeff/Downloads/RPi-OS

# unmount the sd card reader
sudo umount /dev/sdj1

# write the image to the sd card reader
$ sudo dd bs=4M if=2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img of=/dev/sdj
2051+0 records in
2051+0 records out
8602517504 bytes (8.6 GB, 8.0 GiB) copied, 581.67 s, 14.8 MB/s

# ensure the write cache is flushed
sudo sync

# (optional) make a copy of the image from the sd-card
sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdj of=copy-from-sd-card.img
sudo truncate --reference 2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img copy-from-sd-card.img

# (optional) check the integrity of the sd card image
$ diff -s 2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img copy-from-sd-card.img
Files 2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img and copy-from-sd-card.img are identical

# remove the copied image
rm ~/Downloads/RPi-OS/copy-from-sd-card.img
```


#### Step 3: Enable SSH on SD Card - DONE
SSH can be enabled on first boot by placing a file named `ssh` (without any extension),
onto the root directory of the boot partition on the SD-Card:

```bash
# mount the SD card reader by plug it in USB again

# check the mount point
$ df -h | grep media
/dev/sdj2       7.6G  6.6G  672M  91% /media/jeff/rootfs
/dev/sdj1       253M   48M  205M  19% /media/jeff/boot

# enable ssh on first boot
sudo touch /media/jeff/boot/ssh

# unmount the sd card
sudo umount /dev/sdj1 /dev/sdj2
```

As shown above,
while the SD Card is 32GB in size, the image makes it think its about 8GB.

Remove SD card from the reader on your computer.
You can immediately put the SD Card in the RPi and boot it up,
but you will have no WiFi access and you'll need to use the Ethernet interface,
This is fine for me since Ethernet connectivitiy is what I want.

>**NOTE: If the SD-Card is loaded into the Raspberry Pi
>and there is no Ethernet connection for you to use,
>you'll need to use a console cable to make the file modification
>outline in the next step.
>[Adafruit has good description on how to use a console cable][35]
>and the how to [enable the UART for the console][36].

# Prepare Argon ONE M.2 Case for Raspberry Pi 4
If your searching how to best marry a Solid State Drive (SSD) with a Raspberry Pi,
the [Argon ONE M.2 Case for Raspberry Pi 4][20] is the way to go.
With this case, you get support for high speed [M.2 SATA SSDs][26],
combined with the faster USB 3 supported on the RPi 4,
maximizing the true potential speeds of your Raspberry Pi 4.
This able boot via an M.2 SATA SSD for faster boot times,
more reliable and larger storage capacity compared to the traditional microSD Card.


### Step 1: Assemble the Argon ONE M.2 Case - DONE
The physical assembly of the Argon ONE M.2 is easy,
just follow the documentation that comes with the product and online information.
For information about assembly & setup,
follow instruction that come with the Argon ONE M.2,
and check out the following:

Sources:

* [Argon ONE M.2 SSD case for the Raspberry Pi 4 mini PC](https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/raspberry-pi-4-case-07-10-2020/)
* [The Argon One Raspberry Pi 4 Case - Is this the Best Pi4 Case?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VlE654abDo)
* [Argon One Tips and Setup](http://wagnerstechtalk.com/argonone/)
* [Argon ONE Case for Raspberry Pi 4 Updated](https://tech.scargill.net/argon-one-case-for-raspberry-pi4/)


### Step 2: Booting From the SD-Card - DONE
Install the SD Card created earlier,
apply power to the Argon ONE M.2 via a USB C charger for the Raspberry Pi 4,
connect an Ethernet cable from you LAN,
and then press the power switch on the Argon ONE M.2.

Once the RPi boots up,
you can [find your Raspberry P on your network][27] using [`arp-scan`][28]:

```bash
# scan the network for all live hosts
sudo arp-scan 192.168.1.0/24

# or scan the network of a certain type of live hosts
# https://udger.com/resources/mac-address-vendor-detail?name=raspberry_pi_foundation
# https://udger.com/resources/mac-address-vendor-detail?name=edimax_technology_co-ltd

# scan for a raspberry pi with ethernet connection
$ sudo arp-scan 192.168.1.0/24 | grep -e dc:a6:32 -e b8:27:eb -e e4:5f:01
192.168.1.69 dc:a6:32:a7:fe:98 Raspberry Pi Trading Ltd

# scan for a raspberry pi with edimax wifi usb dongle
$ sudo arp-scan 192.168.1.0/24 | grep -e 00:00:b4 -e 00:0e:2e -e 00:1f:1f -e 00:50:fc -e 08:be:ac -e 74:da:38 -e 80:1f:02
192.168.1.26 74:da:38:70:1c:08 Edimax Technology Co. Ltd.
```

Now using the IP address you found for the RPi,
SSH login (`ssh pi@192.168.1.69`)
and run the following commands to update your RPi to the latest software:

```bash
# login into the raspberry pi
# you might want to generate a new key via: sudo ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.69
ssh pi@192.168.1.69

# set the time zone for your raspberry pi device
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York

# update the raspberry pi os
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# clean up any packages no longer needed
sudo apt-get -y autoremove
```

Run the following commands to update your RPi to the latest firmware:

```bash
# do firmware update and reboot
sudo rpi-update

# expand partition to use 100% of remaining space
#sudo raspi-config nonint do_expand_rootfs

# check if you got secured the remaining space on sd card
#df -h

# reboot needed the above to take effect
sudo reboot
```

### Step 3: Prepare Bootloader - DONE
Before editing the bootloader configuration so it uses the M.2 SATA SSD,
make sure you have [updated your system][29] (as shown in previous step)
to get the latest version of the [`rpi-eeprom` package][39].
Now lets [install the stable bootloader][37]:

```bash
# login into the raspberry pi
ssh pi@192.168.1.69

# make sure you have or install the latest bootloader
$ sudo rpi-eeprom-update -d -a
BCM2711 detected
Dedicated VL805 EEPROM detected
BOOTLOADER: up-to-date
CURRENT: Thu  3 Sep 12:11:43 UTC 2020 (1599135103)
 LATEST: Thu  3 Sep 12:11:43 UTC 2020 (1599135103)
 FW DIR: /lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/critical
VL805: up-to-date
CURRENT: 000138a1
 LATEST: 000138a1

# check the bootloader version, as well as the boot order
vcgencmd bootloader_version
vcgencmd bootloader_config

# replace "critical" with "stable", allowing stable updates to be applied
#sudo sed -i 's/critical/stable/g' /etc/default/rpi-eeprom-update

# list the bootloader binaries
$ ls /lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/stable/pieeprom*
/lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/stable/pieeprom-2020-04-16.bin
/lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/stable/pieeprom-2020-06-15.bin
/lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/stable/pieeprom-2020-07-16.bin
/lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/stable/pieeprom-2020-07-31.bin
/lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/stable/pieeprom-2020-09-03.bin

# if not the latest bootloader, update bootloader with version 2020-06-15 or newer and reboot
sudo rpi-eeprom-update -d -f /lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/stable/pieeprom-2020-09-03.bin
sudo shutdown -r now

# recheck the bootloader version
$ vcgencmd bootloader_version
Sep  3 2020 13:11:43
version c305221a6d7e532693cc7ff57fddfc8649def167 (release)
timestamp 1599135103
update-time 0
capabilities 0x00000000

# recheck the boot order to validate the change
# BOOT_ORDER should equal 0xF41 meaning boot from SD-Card first, and if absent, from the USB
$ vcgencmd bootloader_config
[all]
BOOT_UART=0
WAKE_ON_GPIO=1
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0
DHCP_TIMEOUT=45000
DHCP_REQ_TIMEOUT=4000
TFTP_FILE_TIMEOUT=30000
ENABLE_SELF_UPDATE=1
DISABLE_HDMI=0
BOOT_ORDER=0xf41
```

At this points, because of the line `BOOT_ORDER=0xf41` in the bootloader configuration file,
you could boot from the USB.
This assuming you didn't have bootable SD-Card installed on the RPi
and you have installed an operating system to on the M.2 SSD.

### Step 4: Clone SD Card to M.2 SSD - DONE
Now I want to create a copy of my SD Card Raspberry Pi image, with all the data and programs,
and place it on the M.2 SDD so it boots up from there.
To do this, I choose a tool that allows me to clone a SD Card to a bootable USB drive or disk.
That tool is [`rpi-clone`][40].

First, lets prepare the M.2 SSD:

```bash
# install git so you can install rpi-clone
sudo apt install git

# install rpi-clone
mkdir src
cd src
git clone https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone.git
cd rpi-clone
sudo cp rpi-clone rpi-clone-setup /usr/local/sbin

# list block devices to make sure you can access the m.2 ssd
$ lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk
├─sda1        8:1    0   256M  0 part
└─sda2        8:2    0 465.5G  0 part
mmcblk0     179:0    0  29.7G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  29.5G  0 part /
```

```bash
# delete any existing partitions on the m.2 ssd
$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.33.1).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Command (m for help): d
Partition number (1-4, default 4):

Partition 4 has been deleted.
  .
  .
  .
```

With the SSD cleaned up with no pre-existing partitions,
copy over the SD Card image in it entiratiy to the M.2 SSD:

```bash
# do the clone
sudo rpi-clone sda

# check what you have created
lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk
├─sda1        8:1    0   256M  0 part
└─sda2        8:2    0 465.5G  0 part
mmcblk0     179:0    0  29.7G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  29.5G  0 part /
```

### Step 5: Boot from M.2 SSD Drive - DONE
Now halt the Raspberry Pi, remove the SD Card, and allow the Raspberry Pi
to boot from the M.2 SSD drive within the Argon ONE.
You should see the following:

```bash
# check the filesystem
$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root       458G  7.3G  427G   2% /
devtmpfs        1.8G     0  1.8G   0% /dev
tmpfs           1.9G     0  1.9G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           1.9G  8.5M  1.9G   1% /run
tmpfs           5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock
tmpfs           1.9G     0  1.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda1       253M   48M  205M  20% /boot
tmpfs           384M     0  384M   0% /run/user/1000

# check the block devices
$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
└─sda2   8:2    0 465.5G  0 part /
```

We have a `/boot` partition and a `/` partition
Now we will prepare the SSD on the Raspberry Pi for future use.


### Step 6: Partition the SSD - DONE
In the default partitioning given to us via `rpi-clone`,
we have two partitions on the SSD.
There is a partition for the `/boot` filesystem and `/` (aka root).
What about a `/swap` and `/home` partition / filesystem?

(parted) mkpart primary fat32 33.6MB 250MB    # /boot = ~256MB
(parted) mkpart primary ext4 250MB 8GB        # /swap = ~8GB
(parted) mkpart primary ext4 8GB 100GB        # /     = ~100GB
(parted) mkpart primary ext4 100GB 100%       # /home = remainder of disk space (400GB)


#### /swap
RPi generates a RAM size dependant swap **file** in at `/var/swap`,
instead of using an fixed sized swap partition as in most Linux distributions.
It also automatically regenerate the swap file if RAM size changes, to fit the new size.
This is done with the [`dphys-swapfile`][41] utility.

```bash
$ cat /etc/fstab
proc                  /proc           proc    defaults          0       0
PARTUUID=17cd6674-01  /boot           vfat    defaults          0       2
PARTUUID=17cd6674-02  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
# a swapfile is not a swap partition, no line here
#   use  dphys-swapfile swap[on|off]  for that

$ cat /etc/dphys-swapfile
# /etc/dphys-swapfile - user settings for dphys-swapfile package
# author Neil Franklin, last modification 2010.05.05
# copyright ETH Zuerich Physics Departement
#   use under either modified/non-advertising BSD or GPL license

# this file is sourced with . so full normal sh syntax applies

# the default settings are added as commented out CONF_*=* lines


# where we want the swapfile to be, this is the default
#CONF_SWAPFILE=/var/swap

# set size to absolute value, leaving empty (default) then uses computed value
#   you most likely don't want this, unless you have an special disk situation
CONF_SWAPSIZE=100

# set size to computed value, this times RAM size, dynamically adapts,
#   guarantees that there is enough swap without wasting disk space on excess
#CONF_SWAPFACTOR=2

# restrict size (computed and absolute!) to maximally this limit
#   can be set to empty for no limit, but beware of filled partitions!
#   this is/was a (outdated?) 32bit kernel limit (in MBytes), do not overrun it
#   but is also sensible on 64bit to prevent filling /var or even / partition
#CONF_MAXSWAP=2048
```

Is it necessary or recommended to have a `/swap` partitions instead of a swap file?
[On Ubuntu, a separate swap partition been superseded by a swap file within the root partition][42].
So, I'm going with this new convention and not create a swap partition.


#### /home
I prefer to use a separate `/home` partition and not part of the `/` filesystem.
RPi default partitioning doesn't do this.

I will be using [`gparted`][44] (the graphical version of `parted`),
but when I first tried this, I got the message "X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication".
I found the [solution for this][43] and its outlined below.
To make sure everything is working graphically for `gparted`,
lets first make sure X Windows is working properly for the root user:

>**NOTE:** To get this task done, I had to reinstall the SD Card version of RPi OS
>because the SDD cannot be mounted when doing these operations.
>This activity should be done earlier, possibly right after the M.2 SSD is imaged at
>"Step 4: Clone SD Card to M.2 SSD".

```bash
# make sure you login with x-forwarding activated
ssh -X pi@192.168.1.69

# install some x windows apps for testing
sudo apt-get -y install x11-apps

# make sure x windows is working for pi user - it should
xeyes

# does x windows work for root user - it may not
sudo su
xeyes

# if not, apply the fix
cd /
xauth merge /home/pi/.Xauthority

# make sure x windows is working for root user - it should now!
xeyes

# drop out of 'su'
exit
```

Now we can use `gparted` to manage the disk partitions.
`gparted` enables me to resize, copy, and move partitions without data loss.
In this case, I want to reduce the size of the `/` partition to make room for a
to be created partition that will hold the `/home` filesystem.


```bash
# install gparted
sudo apt-get install -y gparted

# start gparted and create new partition using this source
# https://gparted.org/display-doc.php%3Fname%3Dmoving-space-between-partitions
sudo gparted
```

With this completed, remove the SD Card and return to booting from the M.2 SSD.

```bash
# create a temporary mount point to copy files
sudo mkdir /mnt/new-partition

# mount the partition
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/new-partition

# copy over the files to the new partition
sudo cp -RT /home /mnt/new-partition

# get uuid for partition for /dev/sda3 partition
$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid | grep sda3 | awk '{ print $9 }'
a52ce3f1-3dd9-4e98-8f7b-37fdfdc163ac

# make a backup of the filesystem table
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak

# UUID=uuid /path/to/mount_point type defaults,nofail 0 0
# /dev/mmcblk0p5  /home           ext4    rw,user,auto,exec 0       0
UUID=a52ce3f1-3dd9-4e98-8f7b-37fdfdc163ac /home ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0

sudo su
echo "UUID=a52ce3f1-3dd9-4e98-8f7b-37fdfdc163ac /home ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

# copy over the files to backup and remove them
sudo cp -RT /home /home/pi/backup
cd /home
sudo rm -r pi

# mount the partition
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /home

# check it out
$ ls -l /home
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 6 pi pi 4096 Jun 13 21:37 pi

# cross your fingers and reboot
sudo reboot
```

### Step 7: Install Argon Script - DONE
Now we'll install the Argon ONE M.2 Case software script to control
the function of the power switch and the cooling fan.

The Argon ONE M.2 Case has a multi-function power button which operates as follows:

* If the power is currently OFF, a short press turns the power ON.
* If the power is currently ON, there are these press options:
  * double–tap for reboot
  * <3 second, nothing happens
  * >=3 seconds for soft shutdown and power cut
  * >=5 seconds for forced shutdown

The default software setting automatically assumes that after a power failure,
you want the power to remain off.
You can change that behavior with a simple i2c command.
I will change this since I want the RPi to boot up again after a power failure.

Upon installation of the Argon ONE script, by default,
the settings of the Argon ONE cooling system are as follows:

* When the CPU temperature is at 55 C, the fan will run at 10% of its maximum speed
* When the CPU temperature is at 60 C, the fan will run at 55% of its maximum speed
* When the CPU temperature is at 65 C, the fan will run at 100% of its maximum speed


Now lets install the script and set to our liking:

```bash
# install software to control the fan
sudo su
curl https://download.argon40.com/argon1.sh | bash

# set to auto-power-up rpi after power failure - Mode 2 (Always ON)
i2cset -y 1 0x01a 0xfe

# OR must press button to power on from shutdown or power outage - Mode 1
i2cset -y 1 0x01a 0xfd
```

The fan speed can be set based on the temperature of the RPi.

```bash
# for reference, ue this to get rpi temperature in celsius
# fahrenheit - /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp | awk -F "[=\']" '{print($2 * 1.8)+32}'
/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp

# change the fan settings via
sudo vi /etc/argononed.conf
sudo systemctl restart argononed.service
```

If for any reason you want to remove these capabilities, do the following:

```bash
# if desired, uninstall the scripts
argonone-uninstall to uninstall
```

### Step X: Format and Partition the SSD
Often on Linux, when you plug a USB thumb drive in, you're alerted that the drive exists.
Sometimes, however, a drive isn't set-up/organized so it functions.
This will be the case for the M.2 SSD.
To get Linux to recognize it, you need to format and partition the device.

* **Formating** is the process of preparing a data storage device, such as a solid-state drive (SSD), for initial use.
* **Partitioning** is the process of dividing a storage device into local sections,
called partitions, which help organize multiple filesystems and their associated operating systems.
Disk formatting is the process of preparing a data storage device for initial use.

The first step is to get some information about the SSD:

```bash
# list block devices
$ lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk
├─sda1        8:1    0   256M  0 part
└─sda2        8:2    0 465.5G  0 part
mmcblk0     179:0    0  29.7G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  29.5G  0 part /

# list formated / filesystems block devices
$ lsblk -f

└─sda2      ext4   rootfs 66f68227-b1ae-4493-9ef5-e593576a6e81
mmcblk0
├─mmcblk0p1 vfat   boot   B05C-D0C4                             204.2M    19% /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 ext4   rootfs 075b0d0c-7b1e-4855-9547-125591698723   20.5G    25% /

# list partitions

 2      273MB   31.9GB  31.6GB  primary  ext4
```

I see the Samsung 860 EVO SSD 500GB is listed as the `sda` device
with two partitions name `sda1` and `sda2`.

It is generally recommended to have separate partitions for `/`, `/boot` and `swap`.
It is also strongly suggest putting `/home` on a separate partition as well,
even if you do not split the file system hierarchy any further.

First, lets partition the SSD device:

```bash
# list the partitions
$ sudo parted -l
Model: Argon Forty (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 500GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End    Size   Type     File system  Flags
 1      4194kB  273MB  268MB  primary  fat32        lba
 2      273MB   500GB  500GB  primary  ext4


Model: SD SC32G (sd/mmc)
Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 31.9GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags
 1      4194kB  273MB   268MB   primary  fat32        lba
 2      273MB   31.9GB  31.6GB  primary  ext4
```

We'll use the `parted` tool to work on the `/dev/sda` storage device.

```bash
# enter the parted tool to work on /dev/sda
sudo parted --align optimal /dev/sda

# find out how to make a new partition
(parted) help mkpart
  mkpart PART-TYPE [FS-TYPE] START END     make a partition

 PART-TYPE is one of: primary, logical, extended
        FS-TYPE is one of: zfs, btrfs, nilfs2, ext4, ext3, ext2, fat32, fat16, hfsx, hfs+, hfs, jfs, swsusp,
        linux-swap(v1), linux-swap(v0), ntfs, reiserfs, freebsd-ufs, hp-ufs, sun-ufs, xfs, apfs2, apfs1, asfs, amufs5,
        amufs4, amufs3, amufs2, amufs1, amufs0, amufs, affs7, affs6, affs5, affs4, affs3, affs2, affs1, affs0,
        linux-swap, linux-swap(new), linux-swap(old)
        START and END are disk locations, such as 4GB or 10%.  Negative values count from the end of the disk.  For
        example, -1s specifies exactly the last sector.

        'mkpart' makes a partition without creating a new file system on the partition.  FS-TYPE may be specified to set
        an appropriate partition ID.

Now lets format the new partitions:

```bash
# format all the new partitions
sudo mkfs -t fat /dev/sda1      # /boot = ~256MB
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda2     # /swap = ~8GB

### Step 4: Load the Raspberry Pi OS Image on the SD Card
We need to write the Raspberry Pi OS image onto the M.2 SDD,
but for the next step, we'll copy the Raspberry Pi OS to the the SD Card.
To install the OS image on the M.2 SATA SSD,
so we can physically remove the SD-Card,
we'll load the RPi OS image into the `/tmp` directory on the SD Card.

```bash
# place sd card in usb reader and plug into desktop computer

# find the path to the sd card reader and check sd card size
$ df -h | grep media
/dev/sdj2        29G  7.6G   21G  28% /media/jeff/rootfs
/dev/sdj1       253M   54M  199M  22% /media/jeff/boot

# from you desk top computer
# copy rpi image from desk computer to sd card
cp -p /home/jeff/Downloads/RPi-OS/2020-12-02-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img /media/jeff/rootfs/home/pi

# check sd card size
$ df -h | grep media
/dev/sdj2        29G   16G   12G  57% /media/jeff/rootfs
/dev/sdj1       253M   54M  199M  22% /media/jeff/boot
```

















### Step 5: Load Raspberry Pi OS on the M.2 SATA SSD
Often on Linux, when you plug a USB thumb drive in, you're alerted that the drive exists.
Sometimes, however, a drive isn't set-up/organized so it functions.
For those times, you may need to partition and format the device.
Partitioning is the process of dividing a storage device into local sections,
called partitions, which help organize multiple filesystems and their associated operating systems.
Disk formatting is the process of preparing a data storage device for initial use.

########################### MOVER TO PROPER LOCATION ###########################
It is generally recommended to have separate partitions for `/`, `/boot` and swap.
I would also strongly suggest putting `/home` on a separate partition as well,
even if you do not split the file system hierarchy any further.
I want to make the following partitions:
########################### MOVER TO PROPER LOCATION ###########################

First, lets see if we can find out about the SSD drive.
The easy way to list the block devices attached to your Raspberry Pi
via `lsblk` (list block devices) command:

```bash
# place sd card in rpi and boot up

# list block devices
$ lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0 465.8G  0 dism
mmcblk0     179:0    0  14.5G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  14.2G  0 part /

# list formated / filesystems block devices
$ lsblk -f
NAME        FSTYPE LABEL  UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT
sda
mmcblk0
├─mmcblk0p1 vfat   boot   4467-8C16                             198.4M    21% /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 ext4   rootfs 66f68227-b1ae-4493-9ef5-e593576a6e81    5.7G    54% /
```

I see the Samsung 860 EVO SSD 500GB listed as the `sda` device (aka `/dev/sda`).
No evidance of this SSD being partitioned or formated.
`mmcblk0` is the SD-Card and fully prepared, as it must be to operate.

First, lets partition the SSD device:

```bash
# list the partitions
$ sudo parted -l
Error: /dev/sda: unrecognised disk label
Model: Argon Forty (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 500GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: unknown
Disk Flags:

Model: SD SC32G (sd/mmc)
Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 31.9GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags
 1      4194kB  273MB   268MB   primary  fat32        lba
 2      273MB   31.9GB  31.6GB  primary  ext4
```

**NOTE:** The physically installed Argon SSD,
the device/disk `/dev/sda`, has no label and no partition table.
We'll use the `parted` to work on the `/dev/sda` storage device.

```bash
# enter the parted tool to work on /dev/sda
sudo parted --align optimal /dev/sda

# find out how to make a new partition
(parted) help mkpart
  mkpart PART-TYPE [FS-TYPE] START END     make a partition

 PART-TYPE is one of: primary, logical, extended
        FS-TYPE is one of: zfs, btrfs, nilfs2, ext4, ext3, ext2, fat32, fat16, hfsx, hfs+, hfs, jfs, swsusp,
        linux-swap(v1), linux-swap(v0), ntfs, reiserfs, freebsd-ufs, hp-ufs, sun-ufs, xfs, apfs2, apfs1, asfs, amufs5,
        amufs4, amufs3, amufs2, amufs1, amufs0, amufs, affs7, affs6, affs5, affs4, affs3, affs2, affs1, affs0,
        linux-swap, linux-swap(new), linux-swap(old)
        START and END are disk locations, such as 4GB or 10%.  Negative values count from the end of the disk.  For
        example, -1s specifies exactly the last sector.

        'mkpart' makes a partition without creating a new file system on the partition.  FS-TYPE may be specified to set
        an appropriate partition ID.

# show information about the storage device
(parted) print
Error: /dev/sda: unrecognised disk label
Model: Argon Forty (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 500GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: unknown
Disk Flags:

# set the partition table type to GPT
(parted) mklabel gpt

# make your partions
(parted) mkpart primary fat32 0% 100%

# list your partions
(parted) print
Model: Argon Forty (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 500GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End    Size   File system  Name     Flags
 1      33.6MB  500GB  500GB  fat32        primary


# save and quit
(parted) quit
```

Now lets format the new partitions:

```bash
# format the new partitions
sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sda1


$ lsblk -f
NAME        FSTYPE LABEL  UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT
sda
└─sda1      vfat          B5D7-20B1
mmcblk0
├─mmcblk0p1 vfat   boot   4467-8C16                             198.4M    21% /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 ext4   rootfs 66f68227-b1ae-4493-9ef5-e593576a6e81     12G    54% /
```

Now we are going to repeat the steps we performed for preparing the SD-Card,
but now on the M.2 SATA SSD.
We'll the image we moved to the SD-Card (`/home/pi`) by copying it to the M.2 SATA SSD.

```bash
# write the image to the sd card reader
$ sudo dd bs=4M if=/home/pi/2020-12-02-raspios-buster-armhf-full.img of=/dev/sda

# check out how the /dev/sda has been partitioned (just like the sd card was)
$ lsblk -f
NAME        FSTYPE LABEL  UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT
sda
├─sda1      vfat   boot   4467-8C16
└─sda2      ext4   rootfs 66f68227-b1ae-4493-9ef5-e593576a6e81
mmcblk0
├─mmcblk0p1 vfat   boot   4467-8C16                             198.4M    21% /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 ext4   rootfs 66f68227-b1ae-4493-9ef5-e593576a6e81     12G    54% /
```

SSH can be enabled on first boot by placing a file named `ssh` (without any extension),
onto the root directory of the boot partition on the SD-Card:

```bash
# mount the required device
sudo mkdir /mnt
udo mkdir /mnt/boot
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot

# enable ssh on first boot
sudo touch /mnt/boot/ssh

# halt the rpi and remove the sd card
sudo shutdown -h now
```

With this completed, its time to halt the RPi, remove the SD Card from the RPi,
boot from the M.2 SDD for the first time using the image we just installed!

sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/SSD

# copy files from ssd-card to ssd
sudo mkdir /mnt/SSD/boot
sudo cp /boot/*.elf /mnt/SSD/boot

### Step X: Boot from the M.2 SATA SSD
Now shutdown the Raspberry Pi and physically remove the SD-Card from the Argon ONE M.2 Case.
Restart the RPi and you should now be booting off the M.2 SATA SSD.


### Step X: XXX
Using the `blkid` command you can view attributes of block devices that are on your system.

```bash
# display all the block devices that are on your system
sudo blkid

# display the mount point
sudo blkid -o list

# get additional information about a spicific device
sudo blkid -pi /dev/sda

# list all mounted filesytems
findmnt -n -o SOURCE /
```


### Step 3: Booting From the M.2 SATA SSD
By default, Raspberry Pi boots up and stores all of its programs on a microSD memory card,
which has a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 50 MBps on the Raspberry Pi 4,
but even the best microSD cards get no faster than about 38 MBps in sequential writes.
Using an external SSD as your main storage drive could speed things up significantly.

Raspberry PI 4 can now officially boot from USB.
That means you can use SSD or HDD drives instead of SD card.

Steps to be taken:

1. Copy Raspberry OS to an SD-Card
1. Boot the Raspberry Pi using the SD-Card
1. Install the latest bootloader
1. Update your OS and firmware
1. Configure the Raspberry Pi OS to us the SSD

1. Change the PARTUUID on the SSD
1. Change the boot disk definition on the SD-Card
1. Change the root location on the SSD
1. Resize the partition on the SSD

```bash
# update the raspberry pi os
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y full-upgrade

# do firmware update and reboot
sudo rpi-update
sudo reboot

# update the eeprom
sudo rpi-eeprom-update -d -a
sudo raspi-config
```

Using the `blkid` command you can view attributes of block devices that are on your system.

```bash
# display all the block devices that are on your system
sudo blkid

# display the mount point
sudo blkid -o list

# get additional information about a spicific device
sudo blkid -pi /dev/sdc

# list all mounted filesytems
findmnt -n -o SOURCE /
```


### Step 4: Install Argon Scripts




---------------




#### Step X: Set Up a Static IP Address - DONE
By default, the Raspberry Pi will get a dynamically allocated IP-address
To make it easier to connect and have a more stable connection,
we'll give it a static IP address.
Make sure the choose IP address is within the range provided by the router.

```bash
# find the current ip address
$ hostname -I | awk '{ print $1 }'
192.168.1.72

# what kind of network connection are we using
$ route | grep default | awk '{ print $8 }'
eth0

# find your router’s gateway ip address
$ ip route | grep default | awk '{ print $3 }'
192.168.1.1

# find the current dns ip address
$ grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{ print $2 }'
192.168.1.1
```

Now you have found all your network connection information,
we'll edit the DHCP configuration file `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`
to add the settings needed for a static IP address for the Raspberry Pi.
At the bottom of the fill we need to add four lines as follows:

```bash
# make a backup of dhcpcd.conf
sudo cp /etc/dhcpcd.conf /etc/dhcpcd.conf.backup

# add static ip address on ethernet connection
cat <<EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/dhcpcd.conf > /dev/null
# See dhcpcd.conf(5) for details.

# static ip address on ethernet connection
interface eth0
metric 300
static ip_address=192.168.1.203/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1

# dhcp ip address on wifi connection

```


#### Step X: Give the Raspberry Pi a Host Name - DONE
Now lets give the Raspberry Pi a host name of `home-assist`,
reboot, and check if the hostname and IP address have taken effect.

```bash
# setting the hostname for the raspberry pi
sudo sed -i 's/raspberrypi/home-assist/' /etc/hosts
sudo sed -i 's/raspberrypi/home-assist/' /etc/hostname

# reboot the raspberry pi
sudo shutdown -r now

# ssh into the raspberry pi via the new static ip address
ssh pi@192.168.1.203
```

# Install Docker, Docker-Compose, and Portainer On Raspberry Pi

* [How To Install Docker and Docker-Compose On Raspberry Pi](https://dev.to/elalemanyo/how-to-install-docker-and-docker-compose-on-raspberry-pi-1mo)
* [Docker and Home Automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyhBKlcVUW8&list=PL4ed4sZb-R_8dJmakzfBywx1zL9HrFEOy)


#### Step X: Install Docker and Docker Compose - DONE
To install Docker we'll use the instructions for Debian provided by Docker Docs found [here][45].

```bash
# install required perquisites
sudo apt-get -y install ca-certificates curl lsb-release apt-transport-https gnupg2 software-properties-common

# add docker’s official gpg key
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# set up the repository
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# install docker engine and docker compose
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

# check status docker daemon
systemctl status docker

# check that docker is functioning properly
sudo docker run hello-world

# check if hello-world is running
sudo docker ps -a -s
```

>**NOTE:** Receiving a GPG error when running apt-get update?
>Your default umask may not be set correctly,
>causing the public key file for the repo to not be detected.
>Run the following command and then try to update your repo again:
>`sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg`.


#### Step X: Portainer Agent Deployment - DONE
Use the following Docker commands to deploy the Portainer Agent.
Agents are installed on Docker nodes being managed remotely by Portainer.
The agent is not needed on standalone hosts,
however it does provide additional functionality if used:

```bash
# install the portainer agent container
sudo docker run -d -p 9001:9001 --name portainer-agent --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /var/lib/docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes portainer/agent
```


#### Step X: Manage Docker Containers via Desktop Portainer - DONE
We now want to connect the Raspberry Pi so its Docker containers can be monitored
and managed from my `desktop` Portainer.
This is enabled by the Portainer Agent we install in the previous step.

* To connect your Raspberry Pi Portainer Agent,
you do the following on your `desktop` Portainer.
* Select **Environments** from the lefthand menu.
* Select the **Add envirnment** button at top left.
* Select **Agent** and for **Name** enter "smart home",
for **Environment URL** enter `192.168.1.203:9001`
for **Public IP** enter `192.168.1.203:9001`
* Select **Add environment** at the bottom left of the page.

Now if you select **Home** from the lefthand main menu,
you'll see both your local docker containers and the ones on my Raspberry Pi.

# Smart Home / IoT Devices


## ESPHome
Tasmota or ESPHome, together with Home Assistant are often seen together for home automation.
Most of the focus is on flashing and integrating readily available devices and sensors.
But which framework is better also for our do-it-yourself sensors and ESP32 boards.

* [Tasmota vs ESPhome: Who wins?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaFM0tKOvY&feature=youtu.be)

Esphome shows a lot of promise.
It has over-the-air updates, it automatically compiles based on some yaml and uploads it! If it cant upload it (like the initial flash) I would simply set up the yaml, compile it, SCP it locally and flash it with <https://github.com/espressif/esptool>. If this worked, it would now support OTA updates.

Because its a bunch of yaml I can source control it too!

It uses passwords for both API integrations (home-assistant) and for OTA updates (same or different password) which makes me feel good.

Also: the server runs as a container, so its running on my Server network on nomad. I can simply go to <http://esphome.service.consul> and click “Upload” to update my IoT.

## Sonoff

* [How to get started with ESPHome and Sonoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKuma8DJWQ)


### Sonoff S40 Lite Zigbee Smart Plug
I [purchased a SONOFF S40 Lite Zigbee Smart Plug][47]
rated at 15A and claims to work with the Samsung SmartThings and Amazon Echo Plus (which is also a Zigbee hub).
I purchased mainly to to provide another Zigbee node for my most remote Zigbee devices in my basement.
My hope is that this line powered Sonoff device, strategically placed,
will provide a better connectivity for basement devices struggling to provide a reliable connect.

The Sonoff device is administered by the [eWeLink phone app][48].

# Frigate
Frigate is an open source network video recorder (NVR) built around real-time AI object detection.
All processing is performed locally on your own hardware, and your camera feeds never leave your home.

**You need to use RTPS cameras**

>**NOTE:** DVR vs. NVR - What’s the Difference?
>The main difference between the network video recorder (NVR)
>and digital video recorder (DVR) is in how they process raw video data.
>A DVR converts analog footage into a digital format,
>while an NVR typically only works with digital footage.
>DVR systems process data at the recorder,
>while NVR systems encode and process data at the camera
>before transmitting it to the recorder for storage and remote viewing.
>Unless they’ve been reconfigured,
>the DVR connects to an analog CCTV system via a coaxial cable,
>while the NVR connects to an IP camera system over an Ethernet or WiFi connection.
