# Migrating from LastPass to Bitwarden
Easiest way to make your move to Bitwarden be to export from Lastpass,
and then import that file into Bitwarden.
The Bitwarden website has a [good guide on how to do this migration][03]
but mainly followed the process outlined [here][02] and [here][04].

First export the Lastpass vault to CSV file. You can do this from the LP browser extension. Then import the CSV into Bitwarden. That takes care of all passwords. If u have any file attachments in LP make sure to copy those over manually. At this point you can start the process of updating all your passwords using BW. When you finish and double / triple chek that everything had transferred successfully, you can delete your LP account

# Saving New Login to Bitwarden Vault
Bitwarden has two methods for saving passwords:

1. Manual entry before account creation
2. Autosave banner after account creation
