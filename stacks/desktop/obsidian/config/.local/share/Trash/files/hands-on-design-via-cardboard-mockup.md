I have been struggling for a long time for a physical design of my ntp-clock.
I have made some minor attempts at CAD and 3D printed cases but this approach requires
multiple iterations and seems destine for me compermise on the design.
I will invest considerable time & effort, wasting materials, and get something that I'm less than completely happy with.
I then saw a [Hackaday article about Eric Strebel's card board mockup][01].
His phrase "hands on design time" really resignated with me.
It is this "hands on design time" that I'm missing and craving for my process.

I got inspired to build a prototype of my design.

# Styrene Sheets
High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS), often referred to as [Styrene][10],
is a low cost, odorless, and non-toxic plastic.
It is used for indoor signs and lithographs, prototypes, packaging, and toys.
It is also easily machined and fabricated impact-resistant, versatile, and economical plastic.
HIPS is often the preferred material for low strength structural applications.
Its excellent dimensional stability, an affinity for paint, and glue make it an obvious choice for machining pre-production prototypes.

# Mat Board
[Mat Board][16] (or Matte Board or Matboard)
is a heavy paper-based material used in the picture framing process.
Not only does mat board separate the artwork from the glass or acrylic glazing
by providing a barrier to protect and preserve it,
it also provides an aesthetically pleasing border.
Mat boards are most commonly in shades of white or cream,
but you can get them in a variety of rich hues and pastels to complement a variety of art.

# Chip Board
[Chipboard][11] (or Chip Board) is a thick paper that is usually made from 100 percent recycled fiber.
While chipboard is very similar to cardboard,
it is not corrugated with a hollow internally like cardboard.
The backside of a legal pad of paper is one common example of lower-density chipboard,
Floor Board protection paper, used to protect floor surfaces during construction projects,
is an example of one of the highest-density types of chipboard stock.
Unlike many other paper stocks that are categorized on a weight basis,
chipboard is unique in that itâ€™s categorized on its thickness.

# Bristol Paper
[Bristol Paper][12] (Bristol Board or Paper Board) is generally drawing paper that is pasted together to form multi-ply sheets.
Bristol paper provide a stiff, strong surface to work on without the need for mounting.

# Foam Board
Foam Board (or FoamCore, or Paper-faced Foam Board) is a lightweight and easily cut material
often used for mounting of photographic prints, as backing for picture framing,
for making scale models, and in painting.
It consists of a board of polystyrene foam clad with an outer facing of paper on either side,
typically white clay-coated paper or brown craft paper.

A special verity of Foam Board is [Depron][14].
Developed to provide heat and sound insulation,
Depron is a foam sheet material that has become [popular in building model airplanes][15]
and for use in constructing architectural models.
It is constructed from individual closed cells of polystyrene plastic and comes in either white or gray sheets.

# Modeling Foam
Modelling Foam is an easily machined, closed cell rigid foam, ideal for 3D prototyping and modelling.
It can be machined at high speed or or easily worked via hand tools.
The foam is supplied in two densities  where low density foam allows rough models and prototyping at low cost.

# Artist Tape
[Artist Tape][13] has a moderate to low tack adhesive that can be removed
without damaging paper surfaces or leaving behind a sticky residue.
It generally has a white surface and easy to write on for labeling.
