# Getting Started with Obsidian Notes
Obsidian is available as a [cross-platform app][01],
meaning it works on all the major operating systems—Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Obsidian also has a [mobile apps][02] for both iOS and Android.
Obsidian is free for peronsmal use but for commercial purposes,
then there is a [yearly fee][03].
[Obsidian Sync][04] allows you to sync your notes (for a fee) between your devices.


#### Step 1: Download and Install Obsidian
For me, the Linux instance is what I need, and you can get it [here][05],
but in my case, I prefered to make load Obsidian as a Docker container.

As of 03/2023, there doesn't appear to be an offical Docker image for Obsidian
but there is a popular [communitiy supported Docker image][07] on [GitHub][08],
with the image accessable via [GitHub Packages][06].
This repositories `README.md` file covers how to do the Docker install of Obsidian.


#### Step 2: Create a Vault
Once Obsidian is downloaded and installed, open the app.
The first thing it will ask you is to Create a new vault.
Click the purple button and give youtest version or vault a name and a location.

In my case using a Docker container,
I specified this information with the Docker Compose file I used.
