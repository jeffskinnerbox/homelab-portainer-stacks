If your interested in capturing a YouTube video,
there is a very easy approach give in this video: [How to Download youtube videos on Ubuntu linux][14].
Unfortunately, appears YouTube has caught on, and this no longer works.

There is a commandline alternate, `youtube-dl`, documented here:
[Youtube-dl: Perfect tool for downloading YouTube videos in Ubuntu][15] and
[Install YouTube-DL â€“ A Command Line Video Download Tool for Linux][16].
You can find the source and a complete listing of
[`youtube-dl` command line options on Github][17].

Despite its name, `youtube-dl` claims to download videos from not only YouTube.com
but Google Video, Photobucket, Facebook, Yahoo, and many more similar sites.
`youtube-dl` also allows to choose specific available video quality format to download
(or let the program itself automatically download higher quality video)
download user specified list, and much more.

There is a alternative to `youtube-dl` called [`yt-dlp`][49].
`yt-dlp` is a feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader with support for thousands of sites.
Check out ["How to Use YT-DLP: The Complete Guide (2024)"][48].

Pinchflat is a self-hosted app for downloading YouTube content built using `yt-dlp`.
Check out ["Pinchflat - Simple Self-Hosted Youtube Archiver"][50].
