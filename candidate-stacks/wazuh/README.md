Wazuh is a free and open source security platform that unifies
Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) protection for endpoints and cloud workloads.
XDR and SIEM are both cybersecurity solutions that
collect, correlate, and analyze network data to help organizations detect and respond to threats.

* XDR - Focuses on threat detection, investigation, and response, and is better suited for smaller organizations with less data and security events. XDR can provide a more unified view of an organization's security posture by incorporating a broader range of security telemetry data, including endpoint data, network traffic, and cloud-based environments. XDR can then use advanced analytics and automation to detect and respond to threats across the entire IT environment. For example, XDR can make proactive adjustments to network and endpoint defenses to neutralize threats, and can also alert SOC team members to investigate.
* SIEM - Focuses on event logging and long-term analysis, and is better suited for large and complex organizations with a high volume of data and security events. SIEM can provide organizations with insights into their security posture by collecting and analyzing security event data over time, and can help them identify potential areas of weakness. SIEM can also detect and respond to a wide range of threats, including insider threats, external threats, and advanced threats. For example, a next-gen SIEM can improve security operations by reducing false positives, matching indicators of compromise to a particular type of threat, and automating responses.
