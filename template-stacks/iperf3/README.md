iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks.
For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters.

Here we are installing an iPerf3 Docker container so you can test your network hardware to make sure you're getting what you've been told you're getting.
