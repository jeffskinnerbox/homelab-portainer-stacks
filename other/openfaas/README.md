We have all hear the terms Microservices, Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS),
Event-Driven Programming, Serverless but they sound similar and how do they relate?

**[Microservices][04]** are both an architecture and an approach to writing software.
With microservices, applications are broken down into their smallest components, independent from each other.
Instead of a traditional, monolithic, approach (e.g. 3 tier web server),
where everything is built into a single piece,
microservices are all separated and work together to accomplish the same tasks.
Each of these components, or processes, is a microservices.
This approach to software development values granularity, being lightweight,
and the ability to share similar process across multiple apps.
Maybe most importantly, the microservices paradigm lends itself well to [containerization][05].

With **[Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS)][06]**,
you write code to accomplish some specific task
and upload the code for our function to a FaaS provider.
This public cloud provider, or on-premise platform,
then does everything else necessary to provision, run, scale, and manage the code.
As a developer, you don’t need to do anything other than write your code
and wire it up to other functions and services.
FaaS provides programmers with an abstraction that allows them to focus on just writing code
that takes action in response to events rather than interacting
with the underlying server (whether bare metal, virtualized, or containerized).

**[Event-Driven Programming (EDP)][07]** is the use of functions run in response to external events.
It could be a call generated by a mouse click in a web app.
But it could also be in response to some other action,
like the uploading a media file could trigger custom code that transcodes the file into a variety of formats.

**[Serverless][08]** describes a set of architectural patterns that are used to build on FaaS or EDP systems.
Serverless combines custom FaaS code with common back-end services
(such as databases and authentication)
connected primarily through an event-driven execution model.
From the perspective of a developer, these services are all managed by a third-party
(whether an ops team or an external provider).
Serverless is currently an emerging technology area.

Serverless targets specific architectural patterns.
It’s more or less wedded to a programming model in which functions and services
react to each other in an event-driven and largely asynchronous way.
Functions themselves are generally expected to be stateless,
handle single tasks, and finish quickly.
The fact that the interactions between services and functions are all happening over the network
also means that the application, as a whole,
should be fairly tolerant of latencies in these interactions.

# OpenFaaS
With [OpenFaaS][01] you can package anything as a serverless function.
OpenFaaS is an [open source framework][02]
is a framework for building Serverless functions on top of containers,
[accessable via REST-APIs][03] or browser much like AWS' Lambda functions,
using [Docker][13], [Docker Swarm][12], [Prometheus][14], and [Kubernetes][15]
(also check out [Docker Swarm vs. Kubernetes][16]]).
At one point, [OpenFaaS one the most "stared" projects on GitHub][11].

There are similar solutions (OpenShift's [Knative][09], Apache's [OpenWhisk][10]),
but OpenFaaS is also a services provider,
much like Vagrant and Docker, where you can reuse code created by others in the community.
OpenFaaS also differs from serverless products from AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure functions
in that they provide the raw tools & hooks
(they are more like a IaaS with high degree of integration into their platfroms and per-second/minute billing).
OpenFaaS is more of a PaaS (free ... at least so far)
since it provides an orchestration platform
where Docker Swarm and Kubernetes do the heavy lifting for making your function accessable by the world.
